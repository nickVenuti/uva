Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation To Combat 
Terrorism and Terrorist Attacks

October 12, 2001

    I commend the House for passing antiterrorism legislation just one 
day after the Senate took action. The House and Senate bills are 
virtually identical. I urge the Congress to quickly get the bill to my 
desk. We must strengthen the hand of law enforcement to help safeguard 
America and prevent future attacks--and we must do it now.
