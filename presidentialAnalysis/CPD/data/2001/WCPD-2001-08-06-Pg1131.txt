Statement on Senate Action on the ``Emergency Agricultural Assistance 
Act of 2001''

August 3, 2001

    The Senate today took wise and prompt action to help America's 
farmers. This vote is a victory for our Nation's farmers at a time when 
they need it the most. I praise the Senate for agreeing to the House 
bill and look forward to signing this helpful measure into law.
