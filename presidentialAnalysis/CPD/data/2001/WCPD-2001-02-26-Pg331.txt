Statement on the Death of Dale Earnhardt

February 22, 2001

    I have asked my close friend Joe Allbaugh to attend today's memorial 
service for Dale Earnhardt. I am saddened by the untimely loss of this 
American legend and want to express my deepest sympathy to his family, 
friends, and fans. Dale was an American icon who made great 
contributions to his sport. Dale's legacy will live on for millions of 
Americans. He was an inspiration to many.
