Statement on Signing the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 
2001

December 21, 2001

    Today I have signed into law S. 494, the ``Zimbabwe Democracy and 
Economic Recovery Act of 2001.'' This Act symbolizes the clear 
bipartisan resolve in the United States to promoting human rights, good 
governance, and economic development in Africa. My Administration shares 
fully the Congress' deep concerns about the political and economic 
hardships visited upon Zimbabwe by that country's leadership. I hope the 
provisions of this important legislation will support the people of 
Zimbabwe in their struggle to effect peaceful democratic change, achieve 
economic growth, and restore the rule of law.
    Section 4(c) of the Act purports to direct the executive branch to 
oppose and vote against the extension of loans or the cancellation of 
debt in international financial institutions unless and until I make a 
certification or national interest determination. I am concerned that 
this provision burdens my constitutional authority in the area of 
foreign affairs to conduct negotiations and cast votes in international 
organizations. I will construe the provision as being subject to my 
exclusive authority to negotiate or vote in international financial 
institutions.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 December 21, 2001.

Note: S. 494, approved December 21, was assigned Public Law No. 107-99.
