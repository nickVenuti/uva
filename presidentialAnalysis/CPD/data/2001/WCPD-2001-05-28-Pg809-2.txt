Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Achieving Benchmarks 
for a Sustainable Peace Process in Bosnia and Herzegovina

May 25, 2001

To the Congress of the United States:

    As required by the Levin Amendment to the 1998 Supplemental 
Appropriations and Rescissions Act (section 7(b) of Public Law 105-174) 
and section 1203(a) of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I transmit herewith a 
report on progress made toward achieving benchmarks for a sustainable 
peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
    In July 2000, the fourth semiannual report was sent to the Congress 
detailing progress towards achieving the ten benchmarks that were 
adopted by the Peace Implementation Council and the North Atlantic 
Council in order to evaluate implementation of the Dayton Accords. This 
fifth report, which also includes supplemental reporting as required by 
section 1203(a) of Public Law 105-261, provides an updated assessment of 
progress on the benchmarks covering the period July 1, 2000, to February 
28, 2001.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 May 25, 2001.
