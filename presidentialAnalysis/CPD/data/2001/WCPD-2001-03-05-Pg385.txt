Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Critical Infrastructure 
Protection

March 1, 2001

To the Congress of the United States:

    Pursuant to section 1053 of the Defense Authorization Act of 2001 
(Public Law 106-398), enclosed is a comprehensive report detailing the 
specific steps taken by the Federal Government to develop critical 
infrastructure assurance strategies as outlined by Presidential Decision 
Directive No. 63 (PDD-63).
    This report was drafted by the previous Administration and is a 
summary of their efforts as of January 15. However, since this 
requirement conveys to my Administration, I am forwarding the report.
    Critical infrastructure protection is an issue of importance to U.S. 
economic and national security, and it will be a priority in my 
Administration. We intend to examine the attached report and other 
relevant materials in our review of the Federal Government's critical 
infrastructure protection efforts.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
