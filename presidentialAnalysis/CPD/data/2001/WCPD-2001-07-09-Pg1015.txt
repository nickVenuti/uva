Statement on the Death of Heinz C. Prechter

July 6, 2001

    Laura and I were saddened to hear of the death of Heinz Prechter. He 
will be missed. He was a great friend of ours as well as the entire Bush 
family. He was an honorable and loyal man. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with his family during this very difficult time.
