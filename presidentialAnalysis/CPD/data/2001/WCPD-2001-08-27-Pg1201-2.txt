Statement on Senator Jesse Helms' Decision Not To Seek Reelection

August 22, 2001

    The Senate is losing an institution with the decision of Jesse Helms 
to retire after three decades of distinguished public service. Senator 
Helms went to Washington but never became a part of Washington. He has 
always remained true to his conservative principles and to the people of 
North Carolina who elected him five times. Senator Helms is a true 
gentleman, known for treating his colleagues with the utmost respect and 
courtesy, regardless of party or policy differences.
    As chairman and ranking Republican of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, Senator Helms has been a tireless defender of our

Nation's freedom and a champion of democracy abroad. When Senator Helms 
retires, the Senate will have lost a respected leader, but I have no 
doubt we will continue to seek his counsel as a senior statesman.
    Laura and I extend our best wishes to Jesse, his wife, Dot, and the 
entire Helms family.
