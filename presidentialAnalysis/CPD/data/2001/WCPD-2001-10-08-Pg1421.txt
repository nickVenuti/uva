Statement on the Sibir Airlines Crash

October 4, 2001

    I was deeply saddened to learn today of the crash of a Sibir 
Airlines passenger aircraft, flying from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk. My 
heartfelt sympathies and those of the American people are with the 
people of Israel and Russia and the families of the many victims of this 
tragedy.
