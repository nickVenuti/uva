Statement on House of Representatives Action on the War on Terrorism and 
Defense Appropriations Legislation

November 29, 2001

    The House of Representatives yesterday took a bold step to ensure 
that we fully fund the war on terrorism. I commend the passage of the 
Defense Appropriation and the commitment it embodies to ensure that, 
even in war times, we be careful stewards of the taxpayers' money. We 
will fully support our troops in the field, provide the funds necessary 
to recover from the September 11th attacks, and spend whatever is 
necessary to defend our homeland. The agreement I reached with Congress 
in October provides sufficient funds to accomplish these goals at this 
time. I, therefore, urge the Senate to pass the Defense Appropriation 
without adding unwise spending that is not currently necessary.
