Statement: The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, Title III

July 16, 2001

    Today I transmitted to Congress my decision to exercise the 
authority granted to me under the Cuban Liberty and Democratic 
Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act to suspend for 6 months, from August 1 through 
January 31, the right to bring actions under Title III of that Act. In 
exercising this authority, I do so taking into account that it is 
necessary for the national interest of the United States and will 
expedite the transition to democracy in Cuba.
    Real differences remain between the United States and our allies 
concerning the best methods for pursuing change in Cuba. However, for 
its part, the European Union has again renewed its Common Position on 
Cuba and has reaffirmed its goal of promoting a peaceful transition to 
democracy in Cuba. Our actions will encourage support for the embargo 
and further strengthen, not weaken, the growing multilateral, multi-
faceted movement to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba.
    My administration is firmly committed to a proactive Cuba policy 
that will assist the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom. On 
Friday I reaffirmed my commitment to maintain existing sanctions against 
the Cuban regime and to strengthening pro-democracy movements in Cuba. I 
call upon the European Union and the international community to work 
together with us toward the fundamental goals that should unite us: free 
speech, free elections, and respect for basic human rights in Cuba.
