Statement on Congressional Action on Bioterrorism Defense Legislation

December 12, 2001

    I commend Congressmen Tauzin and Dingell for successfully passing 
bipartisan legislation that will help meet our immediate bioterrorism 
defense needs. Their legislation includes many of my priorities, 
including proposals to expand the pharmaceutical stockpile, increase our 
supply of smallpox vaccines, strengthen State and local preparedness, 
and improve the safety of our food supply.
    I look forward to working closely with Congressmen Tauzin and 
Dingell, as well as Senators Kennedy, Gregg, and Frist, to quickly reach 
a bipartisan consensus on this important legislation.
