Statement on House of Representatives Action on the ``Help America Vote Act''

December 12, 2001

    I commend the House of Representatives for today's overwhelming 
passage of the bipartisan ``Help America Vote Act.'' This legislation 
goes a long way toward adopting reforms advocated by the Ford/Carter 
Commission on Federal Election Reform and is based on principles I 
endorsed and recommended to Congress in July. The Ney-Hoyer bill is a 
good start in achieving these goals--it respects the value of every 
eligible vote and the primary role of State, county, and local 
governments in elections. I look forward to working with Congress to 
enact responsible election reform before the upcoming 2002 elections.
