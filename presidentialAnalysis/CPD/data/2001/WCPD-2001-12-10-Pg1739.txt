Statement on the Bombings in Israel

December 1, 2001

    I was horrified and saddened to learn of the bombings that took 
place tonight in Jerusalem. I strongly condemn them as acts of murder 
that no person of conscience can tolerate and no cause can ever justify. 
On behalf of the American people, I extend my deepest sympathy and 
condolences to the families of the victims, to my friend Prime Minister 
Sharon, and to all the people of Israel. Chairman Arafat and the 
Palestinian Authority must immediately find and arrest those responsible 
for these hideous murders. They must also act swiftly and decisively 
against the organizations that support them. Now more than ever, 
Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority must demonstrate through 
their actions, and not merely their words, their commitment to fight 
terror.
