Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President Vladimir 
Putin of Russia in Kranj

June 16, 2001

    Q. Mr. President, any thoughts about this first meeting?
    President Putin. First impression? It was a good first impression.
    President Bush. I rest my case. [Laughter] We're going to have a 
very good meeting, and I've been looking forward to this for a long 
period of time. We find we have a lot in common, and I'm so honored the 
President came here. I know it's inconvenient to travel such a long 
distance, Mr. President----
    President Putin. We know about the very latest statements of 
President Bush in Warsaw, and that's a very good foundation for us to 
proceed.
    President Bush. Thank you, all.

Note: The exchange began at 2:45 p.m. at Brdo Castle. A tape was not
