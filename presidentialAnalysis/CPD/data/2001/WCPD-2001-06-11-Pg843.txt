Statement on the Terrorist Bombing in Tel Aviv

June 1, 2001

    I condemn in the strongest terms the heinous terrorist attack in Tel 
Aviv this Sabbath evening. There is no justification for senseless 
attacks against innocent civilians. This illustrates the urgent need for 
an immediate, unconditional cessation of violence. I call upon Chairman 
Arafat to condemn this act and to call for an immediate cease fire. My 
deepest condolences and those of the American people go out to the 
victims and their families.
