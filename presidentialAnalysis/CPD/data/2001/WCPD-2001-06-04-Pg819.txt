Statement on Signing Legislation To Expedite the Construction of the 
World War II Memorial

May 28, 2001

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 1696, a bill to expedite the 
construction of the World War II memorial in the District of Columbia. 
It is indeed fitting that this measure becomes law on Memorial Day.
    This legislation will allow the Nation to express the appreciation 
due the World War II generation for their selfless sacrifices that 
preserved the freedoms we all enjoy. I commend the Congress for a truly 
bipartisan effort to expedite construction of the memorial.
    Now that debate over the site and basic design is concluded, the 
time has come for all concerned with the creation of the memorial to act 
with the same determination and sense of common purpose so wonderfully 
displayed by those we honor. We must get the job done, so that those who 
served are able to see the Nation's permanent expression of remembrance 
and thanks.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 May 28, 2001.

Note: H.R. 1696, approved May 28, was assigned Public Law No. 107-11.
