Exchange With Reporters at the Jefferson Memorial

July 2, 2001

Fourth of July

    Q. What's the occasion, Mr. President?
    The President. Wanted to come over. We're looking right out our 
window every day at the Jefferson. It's a beautiful day--wanted to come 
over and begin the beginning of the Fourth of July celebration here at 
the Jefferson Memorial. It's an opportunity to say hello to some of our 
fellow Americans.
    Q. What does the Fourth mean to you, Mr. President?
    The President. Well, it's an unimaginable honor to be the President, 
during the Fourth of July, of this country. It means what these words 
say, for starters. The great inalienable rights of our country. We're 
blessed with such values in America. And I--it's--I'm a proud man to be 
the Nation based upon such wonderful values.
    I can't tell you what it's like to be in Europe, for example, to be 
talking about the greatness of America. But the true greatness of 
America are the people. And it's another reason we're here, is to be 
able to say hello to some of our fellow Americans who are here to 
celebrate.
    It's good to see everybody. John [John Berman, ABC News], when are 
you getting married?
    Q. Three weeks, sir.
