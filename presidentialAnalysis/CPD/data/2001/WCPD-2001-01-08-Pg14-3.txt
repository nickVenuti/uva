Statement on John M. Shalikashvili's Report on the Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty

January 5, 2001

    Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John M. 
Shalikashvili and I met this morning to discuss his report concerning 
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The report argues 
persuasively that ratifying the CTBT would increase our national 
security and that the security benefits of the treaty outweigh any 
perceived disadvantages.
    The report's recommendations address concerns raised during the 
October 1999 Senate debate over CTBT. I urge Congress and the incoming 
Bush administration to act on them.
    I also hope the Senate will take up the treaty at an early date as a 
critical component of a bipartisan nonproliferation policy. CTBT is 
supported by our friends and allies overseas and designed to reduce 
existing nuclear dangers as well as those that might emerge in the 
future.
    I commend General Shalikashvili for his thorough and rigorous report 
and his continued service to the Nation.
