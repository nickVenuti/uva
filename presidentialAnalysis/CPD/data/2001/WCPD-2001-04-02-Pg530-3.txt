    Well, it's my honor to welcome to the Oval Office some of our 
leading scientists and entrepreneurs, space entrepreneurs. Ken, thank 
you very much for coming.
    These five folks represented our Nation well in space. They 
represent the best of the country--very capable, strong, smart citizens 
who understand that our Nation must always be exploring space. And I'm 
glad you all are here. Thanks for coming.
    Thank you very much, sir, for being here, as well.
