Statement on the Death of King Birenda of Nepal

June 2, 2001

    I am deeply saddened and shocked at King Birenda's untimely death. I 
also mourn the loss of Queen Aiswarya and other family members and 
extend my deepest sympathies to the King's extended family. I send my 
condolences to the Nepalese people during this difficult period. Our 
prayers are with the Government and people of Nepal.
