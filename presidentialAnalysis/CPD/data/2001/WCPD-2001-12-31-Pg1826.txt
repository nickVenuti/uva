Christmas Greeting to the Nation

December 25, 2001

    Good morning, and Merry Christmas. During this time of conflict and 
challenge, Christmas is a day on which we celebrate hope and joy, when 
our thoughts turn to justice and compassion and to a Prince of Peace 
born long ago. This is a day on which we give thanks for the wonder of 
God's love, for the blessings we have received, and for the families we 
love. And this year all of these things seem particularly important.
    Charles Dickens wrote that Christmas is a time when abundance 
rejoices and want is keenly felt. This Christmas finds many facing hurt 
and loss, especially the families of terror victims and of our young men 
killed in battle. America grieves with you, and we hope you'll 
especially find the comfort and hope of Christmas.
    Laura and I send our good wishes to all the families in America that 
have come together in celebration. We're especially grateful to all the 
men and women of our military, many of whom are today separated from 
their loved ones because they're serving our country.
    Even in this time of war, we pray for peace on Earth and good will 
toward men, and we continue to ask God's blessings on the United States.
    Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year.

Note: The radio greeting was recorded at 10:04 a.m. on December 21 in 
the Cabinet Room for later broadcast, and the transcript was made 
available by the Office of the Press Secretary on December 21 but was 
embargoed for release until December 25.
