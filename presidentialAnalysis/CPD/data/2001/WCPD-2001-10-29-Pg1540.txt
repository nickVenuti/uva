Statement on Northern Ireland

October 23, 2001

    I warmly welcome the announcement by the Chairman of the Independent 
International Commission on Decommissioning, General John de Chastelain, 
that a significant act of decommissioning has been carried out by the 
IRA and verified by the Commission. This is an historic step by the IRA. 
The people of Northern Ireland are now measurably closer to the lasting 
peace which they richly deserve.
    I hope all paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland will build on 
today's events, striving to achieve the total disarmament called for by 
the Good Friday agreement. I know I speak for all Americans when I 
express my heartfelt appreciation to General de Chastelain for his 
continuing efforts in support of the peace process. This act of 
decommissioning will, I hope, lead to the full functioning of the 
political institutions of the Good Friday agreement. All leaders should 
be prepared to intensify their efforts to resolve remaining outstanding 
issues.
