Memorandum on the Naming of the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice 
Building

November 20, 2001

Memorandum for the Administrator of General Services

Subject: Naming of the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building

    Today we mark the 76th anniversary of the birth of Robert F. 
Kennedy, who served this Nation with great distinction in the United 
States Navy, as a respected attorney, as a United States Senator, and as 
our 64th Attorney General. As Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy 
successfully led the Department of Justice in important struggles that 
have come to symbolize the Department's capacity to do good. Whether 
fighting against organized crime or for civil rights, Attorney General 
Kennedy brought out the best in the Department of Justice, working for a 
more just, free, and law-abiding society. It is fitting that the Main 
Justice building in our Nation's capital should be dedicated to Robert 
F. Kennedy's memory, so that generations of Americans yet to come will 
remember his contributions to preserving justice.
    I hereby direct you to designate the Federal Building located at 
10th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., in Washington, District of 
Columbia, as the ``Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building,'' 
and such facility shall be thereafter known and referred to by that 
name.
                                                George W. Bush
