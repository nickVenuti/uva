Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Renewing Normal 
Trade Relations Status for Vietnam

June 1, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit a report including my reasons for determining that 
continuation of the waiver currently in effect for Vietnam under 
subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''), 
will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
