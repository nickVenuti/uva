Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Renewing Normal 
Trade Relations Status for China

June 1, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit a report, including my reasons for determining 
that continuation of the waiver currently in effect for the People's 
Republic of China under subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 
(the ``Act''), as amended, will substantially promote the objectives of 
section 402 of the Act.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
