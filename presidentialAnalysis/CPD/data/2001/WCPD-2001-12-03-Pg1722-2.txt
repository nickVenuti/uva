Statement on Signing Legislation To Prevent the Elimination of Certain 
Legislatively Mandated Executive Branch Reports

November 28, 2001

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 1042, an Act to prevent the 
scheduled elimination of certain legislatively mandated executive branch 
reports. This legislation restores 29 statutory reporting requirements 
that expired last year, pursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and 
Sunset Act of 1995. I sign this legislation in deference to the 
Congress' determination that the reports are necessary to fulfilling its 
oversight responsibilities. But I remain concerned that many of the 
existing statutory reporting requirements impose an excessive burden on 
executive branch agencies. In particular, I am concerned that some of 
the reports reinstated by H.R. 1042 are either obsolete or duplicative 
of other reporting requirements. My Administration will continue to work 
with the Congress to reduce the burden created by unnecessary statutory 
reporting requirements through the elimination of these unnecessary 
requirements, while respecting the oversight responsibilities of the 
Congress.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 November 28, 2001.

Note: H.R. 1042, approved November 28, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
74.
