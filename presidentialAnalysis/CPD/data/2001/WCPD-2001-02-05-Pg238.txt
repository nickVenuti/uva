of the Congress. I'm very serious about sitting down as often as 
possible with people from both parties to have frank discussions about 
issues that concern the country. I believe there is a very good

    Expectations are that nothing will get done. I'm confident that the 
people here in Washington and Members of the Senate don't agree with 
that. We're going to talk about education, and we're going to talk about 
taxes. We'll talk about the patients' bill of rights--a variety of 
issues that are of concern, and what we call front burner issues, issues 
that should be making it through the Congress soon.
    I want to thank the Members for coming. I'm honored that they would 
come down from the Hill to visit the Vice President and me. Thanks for 
coming.

    The President. I'll catch you tomorrow. You missed your chance at

    Q. When are you going to do your first news conference, Mr.

Note: The President spoke at 5:32 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
