Statement on the Back to Work Relief Package

October 11, 2001

    I commend Senators Allen and Warner and others for introducing my 
``Back to Work Relief Package.'' I look forward to continuing to work 
with members of both parties to enact this important relief for 
dislocated workers across America as soon as possible. This proposal 
will help get workers who lost their jobs because of the September 11 
attacks back to work again.
