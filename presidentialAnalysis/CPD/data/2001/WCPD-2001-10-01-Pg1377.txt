Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Defense 
Authorization Bill

September 25, 2001

    I am pleased that the House has taken the vital step to ensure our 
Nation's security by passing the Defense authorization bill. The 
legislation will improve the quality of life for the men and women of 
our Armed Forces by providing the most significant pay raise in recent 
memory. Equally important, the bill strengthens the United States' 
ability to meet the security challenges ahead. I look forward to signing 
a strong bill into law.
