Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister Tony 
Blair of the United Kingdom at Camp David, Maryland

February 23, 2001

    Q. How is it going so far?
    President Bush. Pretty darn good.

Winston Churchill

    Q. How was lunch? Is it true that Churchill once came to this cabin?
    President Bush. That's exactly right.

Meeting With Prime Minister Blair

    Q. How goes the get-acquainted session?
    President Bush. Good, John [John Roberts, CBS News], thank you. 
Ambassador Johndroe was telling us where to go.

Winston Churchill

    Q. Sir, can you tell us the historical significance of where you're 
standing?
    President Bush. This is where Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the 
first visitor to Camp David, stayed. It's a huge honor for Laura and me 
to welcome the current Prime Minister and his wife. And we're about to 
have a press availability to answer all these difficult questions that 
you're throwing at us, John. I promised the Prime Minister that you in 
particular would behave well during the press conference--and Fournier 
[Ron Fournier, Associated Press].
    All right, we're actually now going to go for a walk of a couple 
miles.
    Q. Mr. Prime Minister, where's your coat?
    Prime Minister Blair. It's around somewhere, but actually it's a lot 
warmer than Canada.
    President Bush. You shouldn't have noticed that.

Note: The exchange began at 3:23 p.m. on the porch of Holly Lodge. In
