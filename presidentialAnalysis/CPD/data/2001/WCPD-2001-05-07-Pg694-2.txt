Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders

May 2, 2001

Budget Agreement

    It's my honor to welcome back to the Cabinet Room leaders in the 
House and the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, who worked hard on 
the budget. There is a budget deal; it's an agreement that makes a lot 
of sense. In the agreement is the largest tax cut in a generation and 
reasonable levels of spending.
    This plan could not have been done without the leadership of the 
Speaker and the

leader of the Senate, nor could it have been done without two really 
fine budget chairmen, Congressman Nussle and Senator Domenici, both of 
whom, and their staffs and their committees, worked long, hard hours.
    And finally, it couldn't have been done without the cooperation and 
work of some of our Democrat friends: Breaux in Louisiana and Miller of 
Georgia, Condit of California; Members around this table, who realized 
that it's time--it was time to come together to put a good budget 
together on behalf of the American people; Members who realize that what 
we're talking about is not partisan politics but good budget politics, 
good budget policy. They'll always recognize that we're here to serve 
the people, and this is the people's budget. It's a good budget for the 
working people of America, and I'm proud to congratulate you all for a 
job really well done.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 1:10 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these
