Videotape Remarks for the ``Thanks for Giving'' Campaign

November 20, 2001

    The President. This year, Thanksgiving will mean more than it ever 
has before.
    The First Lady. So many have given their time, their talent----
    The President. ----their bravery, their sacrifice, and courage to 
keep this country strong.

[[Page 1702]]

    Some believe it's astonishing; I believe it's the American 
character.
    The First Lady. As your family gathers, give thanks, and think of 
all that can be done in your community.
    The President. Thanks for making such a difference. Thanks for 
giving.
    God bless you, and God bless America.

Note: The President's remarks were videotaped during the afternoon on 
November 15 at the Bush Ranch in Crawford, TX, for later broadcast. The 
public service announcement and the script were released on the White 
House Web site on November 20.
