Remarks at a Viewing of ``Mark Twain Tonight''

November 29, 2001

    Well, thank you all very much, and good evening. Tonight we'll see 
an extraordinary performer celebrating an extraordinary American life. 
And it is my honor to welcome you all here.
    I particularly want to welcome Dixie Carter. I want to thank the 
members of my Cabinet who are here. I want to thank the Members of the 
Congress who are here. I want to say to the students, thank you for 
coming, and thank you for taking interest in American literature. I want 
to thank your teachers, as well, and all the scholars who have studied 
the life and work of Mark Twain.
    It's also my honor to introduce our host this evening. This 
performance helps mark the beginning of a series titled ``A White House 
Salute to American Authors.'' Promoting American writers is one of 
Laura's, our First Lady's, projects as well as an enduring commitment in 
all her life.
    All America has seen her love of learning and her love of 
literature. All of America has seen her grace and concern for children 
in a difficult time for our Nation. Our country is blessed by her calm 
and compassion, and I am blessed by her encouragement and her love.
    Laura Bush.

Note: The President spoke at 7 p.m. at Ford's Theatre. In his remarks, 
he referred to entertainer Dixie Carter. The transcript released by the 
Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of the First 
Lady.
