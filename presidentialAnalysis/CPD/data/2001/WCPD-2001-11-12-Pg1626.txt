Notice--Continuation of Iran Emergency

November 9, 2001

    On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President 
declared a national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the 
situation in Iran. Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned 
to normal, and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981, 
agreements with Iran is still underway, the national emergency declared 
on November 14, 1979, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2001. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year this national 
emergency with respect to Iran.
    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
