Statement on House of Representatives Action on Trade Promotion 
Authority Legislation

December 6, 2001

    I commend the House of Representatives for passing legislation that 
will restore our Nation's authority to negotiate trade agreements. Trade 
promotion authority will give me the flexibility I need to secure the 
greatest possible trade opportunities for America's farmers, workers, 
families, and consumers.
    Trade promotion authority is a key part of our trade agenda. It will 
help us pursue and complete trade agreements, including the global trade 
negotiations launched last month in Doha, Qatar. By promoting open 
trade, we expand export markets and create high-paying jobs for 
Americans, while providing opportunities for other nations as a result 
of free trade.
    Now that the House has acted, I urge the Senate to move quickly to 
send me a trade promotion authority bill I can sign.
