Statement on Signing the Department of Transportation and Related 
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002

December 18, 2001

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2299, the ``Department of 
Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002.''
    I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this 
Act. The bill abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for 
Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion and supports several of my 
Administration's key initiatives with:
 <bullet>    $140 million for border safety to ensure an open border for 
            trade between the United States and Mexico through the 
            establishment of an inspection and certification system that 
            will ensure a high level of motor carrier safety;
 <bullet>    $5 billion for Coast Guard operations and capital expenses, 
            including $243 million to support expanded drug interdiction 
            efforts as authorized in the Western Hemisphere Drug 
            Elimination Act;
 <bullet>    $1.2 billion for the newly created Transportation Security 
            Administration to enhance airport and aircraft security;
 <bullet>    $32.8 billion for key highway infrastructure and safety 
            initiatives in compliance with authorized levels;
 <bullet>    $10.2 billion for aviation operations and airport 
            improvement grants to expand safety, security, and capacity; 
            and
 <bullet>    $6.7 billion for mass transit grants and capital programs.
    Several provisions in the bill purport to require congressional 
approval before executive branch execution of aspects of the bill. I 
will interpret such provisions to require notification only, since any 
other interpretation

would contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS v. Chadha.
