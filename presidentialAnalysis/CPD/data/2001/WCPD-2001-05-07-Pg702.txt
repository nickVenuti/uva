Message on the Observance of Cinco de Mayo

May 2, 2001

    I am pleased to send warm greetings to all those gathered to 
celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
    May 5th marks the triumph of the spirit of freedom for the people of 
Mexico. The victory of General Ignacio Zaragoza and his Mexican troops 
over the superior French forces at the Battle of Puebla served as a 
stirring reminder of the determination to win the fight for Mexico's 
freedom from foreign intervention. The Cinco de Mayo display of courage 
and purpose is a source of pride for all freedom-loving people.
    We Americans cherish our deep historical, cultural, economic, and, 
in many cases, family ties with Mexico and Latin America. Cinco de Mayo 
celebrations remind us how much Hispanics have influenced and enriched 
the United States. Hispanic Americans contribute to the shared 
traditions that are part of our history, including entrepreneurship, a 
sense of community where neighbor helps neighbor, faith, and love of 
family. On this special day, I encourage Americans to reaffirm the ties 
of culture and friendship we share with the people of Mexico and with 
Hispanic Americans.
     As you enjoy the day with parades, folkloric dancing, and other 
festive activities, Laura joins me in sending best wishes for a joyous 
celebration.
                                                George W. Bush
