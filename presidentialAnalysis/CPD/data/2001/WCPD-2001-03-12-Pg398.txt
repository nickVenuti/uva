Statement on the National Guard Aircraft Tragedy in Georgia

March 3, 2001

    I was deeply saddened to learn of the loss of 21 members of the 
Florida and Virginia National Guard aboard a C-23 transport plane that 
crashed this morning outside Macon, Georgia. This tragic loss on a 
routine training mission reminds us of the sacrifices made each and 
every day by all of our men and women in uniform. The price of freedom 
is never free. Today's events remind us that it is sometimes unspeakably 
high. On behalf of the entire Bush family, I extend our deepest 
condolences to the families of the victims and to all members of the 
171st Aviation Battalion of the Florida Army National Guard and the 203d 
Red Horse Flight of the Virginia Air National Guard. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with you all during this very difficult time.
