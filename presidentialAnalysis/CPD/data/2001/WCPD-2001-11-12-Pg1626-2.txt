Message to the Congress on the Continuation of the National Emergency 
With Respect to Iran

November 9, 2001

To the Congress of the United States:

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the Iran emergency declared by Executive 
Order 12170 on November 14, 1979, is to continue in effect beyond 
November 14, 2001, to the Federal Register for publication. The most 
recent notice continuing this emergency was published in the Federal 
Register on November 13, 2000 (65 Fed. Reg. 68061).
    Our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the 
process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is 
still underway. For these reasons, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national emergency declared on November 14, 
1979, with respect to Iran, beyond November 14, 2001.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 November 9, 2001.
