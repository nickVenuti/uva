Statement on House of Representatives Action on Insurance Industry 
Terrorist Claims Legislation

November 29, 2001

    I commend the House for taking an important step toward ensuring the 
continued availability of insurance for terrorist-related acts and for 
ensuring that victims of terrorism don't also become subjects of unfair 
lawsuits. Access to affordable insurance is necessary for a stable and 
productive economy where builders continue to build and investors 
continue to invest. It is time for the Senate to focus on this important 
issue.
