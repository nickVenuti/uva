Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Peacekeeping 
Operations in Kosovo

November 2, 2001

Dear __________ :

    As required by section 1213 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, Public Law 106-398, I transmit 
herewith a semiannual report on the contributions of European nations 
and organizations to the peacekeeping operations in Kosovo.
    This report, prepared by the Department of State, concludes that the 
Europeans have carried a significant portion of the aid-sharing burden 
in the region and that their commitment to reconstruction, humanitarian 
relief, and institution and peace-building has been a strong one. 
Continued attention and commitments of assistance from all donors 
remains crucial for medium- and long-term development in Kosovo.
    Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
