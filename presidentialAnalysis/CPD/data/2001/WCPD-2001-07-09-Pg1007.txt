Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on the Extension 
of Normal Trade Relations Status With Belarus

July 2, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit the report referred to in subsection 402(c)(2) of 
the Trade Act of 1974, with respect to a waiver of the application of 
subsections 402(a) and (b) of that Act to the Republic of Belarus.
    I have determined that such a waiver will substantially promote the 
objectives of section 402, and I have instructed the Secretary of State 
to provide a copy of that determination to the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives and President of the Senate. The report also indicates 
that I have received the assurances with respect to the emigration 
practices of the Republic of Belarus required by section 402(c)(2)(B) of 
the Act.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
