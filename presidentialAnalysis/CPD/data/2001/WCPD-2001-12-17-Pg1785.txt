Message on the Observance of Eid al-Fitr

December 13, 2001

    I am pleased to send greetings and best wishes to those across the 
globe who are celebrating Eid al-Fitr.
    For Muslims, the Eid is a festive occasion, celebrating service 
rendered to God during the holy month of Ramadan. During this special 
time, it is also a tradition to help those in need. Performing acts of 
charity remains a tradition common across many faiths, challenging each 
of us to make a positive difference in the lives of others through 
generosity, kindness, and compassion.
    Today, due to drought and dictatorship, millions of people in 
Afghanistan are hungry and face the prospect of a harsh winter. 
Americans are working with many nations to provide food, medicine, and 
clothing to the people of Afghanistan. We resolve to work in partnership 
with other nations to assist with rebuilding their nation.
    The teachings of many faiths share much in common. And people of 
many faiths are united in our commitments to love our families, to 
protect our children, and to build a more peaceful world. In the coming 
year, let us resolve to seize opportunities to work together in a spirit 
of friendship and cooperation. Through our combined efforts, we can end 
terrorism and rid our civilization of the

damaging effects of hatred and intolerance, ultimately achieving a 
brighter future for all.
    Laura and I wish Muslims around the world a joyous Eid, and peace, 
health, and prosperity in the year ahead.
                                                George W. Bush
