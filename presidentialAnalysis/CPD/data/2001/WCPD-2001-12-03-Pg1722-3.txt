Statement on Signing the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act

November 28, 2001

    Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 1552, which will ensure 
that the growth of the Internet is not slowed by additional taxation.
    The Internet is an innovative force that enables such applications 
as distance learning and precision farming. Government must do its part 
to make access to these services affordable. It should not raise costs 
through additional taxation.
    Extending the moratorium is particularly important during this 
crucial holiday shopping season. Online spending is estimated to account 
for over 15 percent of total holiday purchases this year. H.R. 1522 will 
keep access to e-commerce services affordable. This law will be a big 
help to those Americans who shop from home because they are unable to 
travel to stores and malls.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 November 28, 2001.

Note: H.R. 1552, approved November 28, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
75.
