Statement on Signing Legislation Establishing the Detroit River 
International Wildlife Refuge

December 21, 2001

    Today I am very pleased to sign into law H.R. 1230, which will 
establish the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, the first-
ever international wildlife refuge.
    The Detroit River on the Michigan-Canada border has lost over 95 
percent of its coastal wetland habitat and has been designated a 
Waterfowl Habitat Area of Concern by the Canadian and American 
governments. Establishing this International Wildlife Refuge will do a 
lot to provide this special place with the protection that it needs.
    This area is a prime waterfowl migration corridor and is considered 
a special place for sportsmen, birders, and boaters. An estimated 
300,000 diving ducks stop in the River to rest and feed during their 
fall migration

from Canada. At least 65 species of fish live in the Detroit River, 
including millions of walleye.
    This innovative legislation enhances public-private partnerships for 
conservation and habitat restoration. I want to thank the many area 
businesses and groups that developed the conservation vision for the 
refuge.

Note: H.R. 1230, approved December 21, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
