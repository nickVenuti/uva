Message to the Congress Transmitting the District of Columbia Courts FY 
2002 Budget Submission

May 2, 2001

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the District of Columbia Code, as amended, I am 
transmitting the District of Columbia Courts FY 2002 Budget Submission.
    The District of Columbia Courts have submitted a FY 2002 budget 
request for $111.7 million for operating expenses, $41.4 million for 
capital improvements to courthouse facilities, and $39.7 million for 
Defender Services in the District of Columbia Courts. My FY 2002 budget 
includes recommended funding levels of $105.2 million for operations, 
$6.0 million for capital improvements, and $34.3 million for Defender 
Services. My transmittal of the District of Columbia Courts' budget 
request does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
    I look forward to working with the Congress throughout the FY 2002 
appropriations process.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
