Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Patients' Bill of 
Rights

August 2, 2001

    Today's action brings us an important step closer to ensuring that 
patients get the care they need and that HMOs are held accountable.
    I appreciate the bold leadership and hard work of Speaker Hastert, 
Congressman Norwood, Congressman Fletcher, and others for their efforts 
to make patient protections a reality for all Americans after years of 
gridlock.
    As this bill heads to the conference committee, I remain committed 
to extending the hand of cooperation to all who share a commitment to 
achieving real results for better health care for every American.
