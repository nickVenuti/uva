Statement on Flooding in the Upper Mississippi River Basin

April 19, 2001

    I know that all Americans share my concern for the displaced 
families and residents of Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois. 
Yesterday the Mississippi River engulfed homes and businesses. Even more 
flooding is predicted in the upcoming days.
    Those who live and work along the upper Mississippi are not 
strangers to the threat of spring floods. Since the 1993 floods, many 
communities and residents have taken measures to protect themselves and 
their property. They are to be commended for this preventative work.
    At my direction, FEMA Director Joe Allbaugh and his staff are 
working closely with State and local officials throughout the impacted 
and threatens areas to closely track the flooding and any further 
damage. As I travel to Canada for the Summit of the Americas, I will 
continue to monitor the situation.
