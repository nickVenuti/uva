Statement on Signing the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002

November 28, 2001

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2330, the ``Agriculture, Rural 
Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act, 2002.''
    I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this 
Act. The Act abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for 
Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion. It provides for several important 
programs with significant national benefits by:
 <bullet>    fully funding the current participation rate for the key 
            nutrition program for women, infants, and children;
 <bullet>    supporting Department of Agriculture (USDA) food safety 
            activities, including providing 7,600 meat and poultry 
            inspectors; and
 <bullet>    redirecting USDA research to provide new emphasis in key 
            areas such as biotechnology, the development of new 
            agricultural products, and improved protection against 
            emerging exotic plant and animal diseases, as well as crop 
            and animal pests.
    A number of provisions contained in the bill purport to restrict 
executive branch execution of programs that are funded in the bill. 
Where such provisions contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS v. 
Chadha, their intent will be interpreted as advisory only.
    I appreciate that the Congress has worked expeditiously during this 
difficult and trying time in our Nation's history to consider the FY 
2002 appropriations bills. Through a renewed sense of bipartisanship, 
the Congress and my Administration must work together to ensure the 
timely enactment of the remaining bills.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 November 28, 2001.

Note: H.R. 2330, approved November 28, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
76.
