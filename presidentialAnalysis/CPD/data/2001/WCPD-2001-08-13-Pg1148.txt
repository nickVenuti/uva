Statement on the Death of Maureen Reagan

August 8, 2001

    Laura and I are deeply saddened to learn of Maureen Reagan's death. 
Maureen was a devoted, caring daughter and mother. She fought tirelessly 
to increase funding for Alzheimer's research and raise public awareness 
of the disease. Our thoughts and prayers are with Maureen's husband, 
Dennis, their daughter, Rita, and the entire family.
