Statement on the Earthquake in India

January 26, 2001

    I am saddened by the news of the tragic earthquake centered in 
India's Gujarat state this morning. I extend my condolences and those of 
the American people to the families of the many victims in the cities 
and villages of Gujarat and elsewhere. Earthquakes know no political 
boundaries: I send condolences to the people affected in neighboring 
Pakistan as well. We stand ready to assist as needed and as desired by 
the Governments.
