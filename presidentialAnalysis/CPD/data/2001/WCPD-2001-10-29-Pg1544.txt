Statement on Congressional Action on Counterterrorism Legislation

October 24, 2001

    I am pleased Congress has reached an agreement on counterterrorism 
legislation that will give our law enforcement officials the tools and 
resources necessary to disrupt, weaken, and defeat terrorists. I look 
forward to signing this strong bipartisan plan into law so that we can 
combat terrorism and prevent future attacks.
