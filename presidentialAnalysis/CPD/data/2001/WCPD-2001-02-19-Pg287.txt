Remarks on Departure for Charleston, West Virginia

February 14, 2001

Situation in the Middle East

    Good morning. I strongly condemn the terrible act of violence in 
Israel this morning. I have called Prime Minister Barak to express my 
condolences to the families of the people killed and to all the Israeli 
people.
    As I told the Prime Minister, the tragic cycle of violent action and 
reaction between Israel and the Palestinians, particularly the 
escalation this week, needs to stop. I'm urging all parties to do their 
utmost to end the violence.
    We will continue to work with all parties to try to restore calm to 
the region.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 8:55 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of 
Israel.
