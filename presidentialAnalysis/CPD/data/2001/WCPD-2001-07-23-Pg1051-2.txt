Statement on Action by Committees of the House of Representatives on a 
National Energy Policy

July 17, 2001

    Today's actions in the House Resources Committee and in the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee represent important steps toward 
implementing a comprehensive and balanced energy policy. I am pleased 
that the committees are acting swiftly to increase energy efficiency, 
expand use of renewables, and open a small portion of the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge for environmentally responsible exploration.
    For too long America has lacked a comprehensive national energy 
policy. My administration has proposed a plan that will reduce America's 
reliance on foreign oil through increased conservation and efficiency, 
improved infrastructure, and increased exploration. I commend the House 
committees for moving forward on these goals.
