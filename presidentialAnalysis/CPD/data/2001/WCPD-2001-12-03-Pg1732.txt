Statement on Congressional Action on Mexican Motor Carrier Legislation

November 30, 2001

    The compromise reached by the House and Senate appropriators on 
Mexican trucking is an important victory for safety and free trade. We 
must promote the highest level of safety and security on American 
highways while meeting our commitments to our friends to the South. The 
compromise reached by the conferees will achieve these twin objectives 
by permitting our border to be opened in a timely manner and ensuring 
that all United States safety standards will be applied to every truck 
and bus operating on our highways.
