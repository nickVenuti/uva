Message to the Congress Transmitting a Notice on the Continuation of 
Emergency With Respect to Burma

May 15, 2001

To the Congress of the United States:

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the emergency declared with respect to Burma is to continue in effect 
beyond May 20, 2001. The most recent notice continuing this emergency 
was published in the Federal Register on May 19, 2000.
    As long as the Government of Burma continues its policies of 
committing large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma, 
this situation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this 
reason, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain in force 
these emergency authorities beyond May 20, 2001.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 May 15, 2001.
