Statement on Senate Action on a Bilateral Trade Agreement With Vietnam

October 3, 2001

    Today's Senate action to establish a bilateral trade agreement with 
Vietnam is a significant step toward strengthening the ties between our 
two countries and promoting strength and stability in this important 
region. The agreement will provide American companies with access to a 
large and growing market and, through the reforms it promotes, it will 
help create a more prosperous and engaged Vietnam. The trade agreement 
also brings hope for improving human rights. I look forward to signing 
this legislation into law.
