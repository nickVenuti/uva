Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Blueprint for the ``New 
Freedom Initiative''

February 1, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Enclosed please find the blueprint for my ``New Freedom Initiative'' 
to increase investment in and access to assistive technologies and a 
quality education, and help integrate Americans with disabilities into 
the workforce and into community life. I look forward to working with 
the Congress to ensure that these proposals are enacted into law and to 
working together to ensure that every American with a disability has 
access to the American dream.
    Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
