Statement on the Floods in Thailand

August 16, 2001

    I am very saddened to learn of the tragic deaths that have occurred 
as a result of on-going flooding in northern Thailand. This disaster, 
which has already claimed more than 100 lives, is particularly cruel 
because it occurred during a holiday weekend, when many Thais had 
traveled to their hometowns and villages. The American people join me in 
sending our condolences to all those in Thailand who have lost loved 
ones, suffered injury or other loss as a result of the flooding. Our 
sympathy for the Thai people at this difficult time is heightened by our 
common experience with recent flooding, casualties, and destruction.
    The United States stands ready to assist the Royal Thai Government 
and the Thai people to respond to the effects of the flooding. Our 
Embassy in Bangkok is in the process of providing emergency support, 
through the Thai Red Cross, to the initial relief efforts. I hope that 
our assistance, and the lasting friendship of the United States with the 
Royal Thai Government and the Thai people, will be helpful as Thailand 
works to overcome the tragic effects of the flooding.
