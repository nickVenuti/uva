Statement on the Death of Representative John Joseph Moakley

May 28, 2001

    Laura and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Moakley family. Joe 
was a fine man. As a veteran and later a Congressman, he served his 
country and the people of Massachusetts with distinction and honor. He 
was respected by his colleagues on both sides of the aisle and was known 
for his candor, wit, and humility. We will miss him.
