Statement on Former President Ronald Reagan's Hip Surgery

January 14, 2001

    Hillary and I are relieved that President Reagan's treatment for his 
injury appears to have been successful. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with the President, his wife, Nancy, and the entire Reagan family during 
this difficult period. We join all Americans in wishing him a speedy 
recovery.
