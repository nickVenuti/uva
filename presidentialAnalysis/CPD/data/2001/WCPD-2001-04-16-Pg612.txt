Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1), and as part of my effort to keep the 
Congress fully informed, I am reporting on the status of efforts to 
obtain Iraq's compliance with various resolutions adopted by the United 
Nations Security Council. The last report, consistent with Public Law 
102-1, was transmitted on January 19, 2001.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
