Statement on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve

November 13, 2001

    The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is an important element of our 
Nation's energy security. To maximize long-term protection against oil 
supply disruptions, I am directing today the Secretary of Energy to fill 
the SPR up to its 700 million barrel capacity.
    The SPR will be filled in a deliberate and cost-effective manner. 
This will be done principally through royalty-in-kind transfers to be 
implemented by the Department of Energy and the Department of the 
Interior.
    Our current oil inventories, and those of our allies who hold 
strategic stocks, are sufficient to meet any potential near-term 
disruption in supplies. Filling the SPR up to capacity will strengthen 
the long-term energy security of the United States.
                                                George W. Bush
