Message to the Congress on the Declaration of National Emergency by 
Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks

September 14, 2001

To the Congress of the United States:

    Pursuant to section 201 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 
1621), I hereby report that I have exercised my authority to declare a 
national emergency by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade 
Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and the continuing and 
immediate threat of further attacks on the United States. A copy of my 
proclamation is attached.
    Further, I have authorized, pursuant to section 12302 of title 10, 
United States Code, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of 
Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating 
as a service within the Department of the Navy, to order to active duty 
units and individual members not assigned to units of the Ready Reserve 
to perform such missions the Secretary of Defense may determine 
necessary. The deployment of United States forces to conduct operational 
missions in connection with the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks 
necessitates this action. A copy of my Executive Order implementing this 
action is attached.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 September 14, 2001.
