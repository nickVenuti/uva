Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated solution of the 
Cyprus question covering the period October 1 through November 30, 2001. 
The previous submission covered August 1 through September 30, 2001. The

the United Nations effort to find a just and lasting settlement to the 
Cyprus problem.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
