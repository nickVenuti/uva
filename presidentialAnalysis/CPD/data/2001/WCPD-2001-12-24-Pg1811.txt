Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Economic Stimulus 
Package

December 20, 2001

    I commend the House of Representatives for its leadership in passing 
an economic security package that will help workers and get our economy 
growing. This bipartisan plan will help ensure that workers have access 
to health care and unemployment benefits, that new jobs will be created, 
and that people will have more money in their pockets. For the sake of 
America's workers, I call on the Senate to act now on this plan, which 
can pass the Senate with a bipartisan majority if it is brought up for a 
vote. If this bipartisan bill gets to my desk, I will sign it.
