Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus

January 17, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period October 1-November 30, 2000. The 
previous submission covered events during August and September 2000.
    The United Nations continued its efforts to bring about a 
comprehensive settlement between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots 
with the fifth session of proximity talks in Geneva from November 1 to 
10. Special Presidential Emissary Alfred Moses, Special Cyprus 
Coordinator Thomas Weston, and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald Bandler 
continued to provide diplomatic support to the process. The United 
Nations Secretary General invited both parties to continue talks in 
Geneva in late January. The United States remains committed to the 
United Nations process and efforts to bring about a solution based upon 
a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the 
Office of the Press Secretary on January 18.
