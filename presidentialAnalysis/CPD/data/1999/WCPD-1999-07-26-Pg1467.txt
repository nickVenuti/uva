Statement on Senate Action on Hate Crimes Legislation

July 22, 1999

    I am gratified that the Senate has unanimously passed the strong 
legislation I proposed to combat hate crimes.
    All Americans deserve protection from hate crimes, and that requires 
us to stand together against intolerance, prejudice, and bigotry. The 
``Hate Crimes Prevention Act'' gives power to those values and will help 
make our country more safe and secure.
    Senate approval of this legislation gives it real momentum, and I 
call on the House of Representatives to meet its responsibility in 
combating violence that is fueled by hate. We have some distance to go 
before the ``Hate Crimes Prevention Act'' is the law of the land, but 
tonight's action by the Senate is a big step forward in the journey 
toward greater protection for all Americans.
