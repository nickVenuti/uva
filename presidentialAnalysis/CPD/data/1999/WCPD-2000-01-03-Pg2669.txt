Statement on Providing Disaster Assistance to Venezuela

December 23, 1999

    Today I authorized a $20 million drawdown of emergency disaster 
assistance to support relief operations in Venezuela. This assistance, 
to be drawn from existing Department of Defense inventories, will 
augment the $5.5 million we have already committed to Venezuela. These 
funds will support continued search and rescue operations by U.S. 
military helicopters now on the scene, airlift of food, shelter, and 
medicines, water purification systems, and other critical needs.
    As I told President Chavez when I spoke to him by telephone on 
Tuesday, we are deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation that 
has taken place in Venezuela. The heroic response of the Venezuelan 
people to this calamity has left a profound impression on all of us. 
Through the efforts of our military and USAID, we will continue to do 
everything possible to help the people of Venezuela. Providing this 
assistance is not only the right thing to do; it also promotes our 
interest in ensuring stability in a nation that is a key partner in the 
hemisphere.
    At this holiday season, the people of Venezuela are in our thoughts 
and prayers.
