Statement on Senate Action on the Proposed ``African Growth and 
Opportunity Act''

October 26, 1999

    I applaud the strong, bipartisan vote in the Senate to move forward 
with consideration of the ``African Growth and Opportunity Act.'' This 
historic legislation will help build a partnership that will strengthen 
economic and political ties, increase trade, and boost economic growth 
and opportunity in both the United States and Africa. It will strengthen 
the relationship between our Nation and a continent entering a new era 
of democracy and economic progress. I urge Congress to pass this 
legislation this year.
