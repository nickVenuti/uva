Message to the Citizens of Oklahoma City on the Fourth Anniversary of 
the Bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building

April 14, 1999

    Greetings to everyone gathered in Oklahoma City to remember those 
who died in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
    The bombing on April 19, 1995, stole the lives of 168 people and 
brought grief to the victim's families and to our entire nation. This 
cowardly act of terrorism outraged not only the people of the United 
States, but also civilized men and women everywhere.
    As you gather to mark the fourth anniversary of that tragedy, I know 
that your memories of the loved ones you lost are undiminished by the 
passing of time. I know, too, that all Americans still share your 
sorrow.
    Four years ago, you were brought together by your devastating loss. 
In the years since, you have reached out to forge new ties of community, 
turning your shared sadness into a source of strength for all Americans. 
As you prepare to dedicate the national memorial at next year's 
observance, I commend you for your courage and your dedication in 
creating a lasting tribute to the memory of your loved ones.
    Hillary and I are keeping all of you in our thoughts and prayers.
                                                  Bill Clinton
