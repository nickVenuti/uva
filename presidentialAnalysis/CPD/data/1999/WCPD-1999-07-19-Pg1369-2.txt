Statement on the Deutch-Specter Commission Report

July 14, 1999

    I welcome the report of the Commission To Assess the Organization of 
the Federal Government To Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass 
Destruction (the Deutch-Specter Commission).
    The Chairman, John Deutch, the Vice Chairman, Senator Specter, and 
other commissioners have provided a comprehensive study of how we should 
organize the U.S. Government to deal with the threat of proliferation, 
which poses one of the most serious challenges to national and 
international security that we face.
    The Commission's report contains a number of interesting 
recommendations and observations that deserve serious consideration. I 
have asked my National Security Adviser, Samuel Berger, to coordinate an 
interagency review and assessment of the Commission's recommendations 
and report back to me within 60 days with advice on specific steps.
