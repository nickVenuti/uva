Exchange With Reporters Following Discussions With Prime Minister Janez 
Drnovsek of Slovenia in Ljubljana

June 21, 1999

    Q. Mr. Prime Minister, I wonder if you could tell us what President 
Clinton's visit means to your country, what you hope to get out of the 
visit?
    Prime Minister Drnovsek. [Inaudible]--to visit, the first time we 
have the President of the United States in Slovenia, and I think it is 
confirmation of excellent relations that we established during the last 
year. And we cooperated in southeast situation; the Kosovo crisis was 
another crisis.
    So I think this is a confirmation for Slovenia, for our partnership, 
because of our role in this part of the world.

President Boris Yeltsin of Russia

    Q. Mr. President, yesterday you had a chance to sit down across the 
table from Boris Yeltsin. We saw him get off at the airport--he looked 
very frail, at times his speech sounded slurred. You sat across the 
table, eyeball-to-eyeball, how would you assess Boris Yeltsin today?
    President Clinton. Yesterday, I can say, his movements were halting, 
but his mind was quite clear; he was very precise, very strong, and very 
eager for us to resolve our past differences and go on into the future. 
I actually was reassured by the meeting. I thought he was quite strong 
and quite clear yesterday.

Note: The exchange began at 4:55 p.m. in the Presidential Palace. A tape 
was not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
