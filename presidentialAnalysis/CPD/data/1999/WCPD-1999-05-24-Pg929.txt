Statement on the Election of Ehud Barak as Prime Minister of Israel

May 17, 1999

    On behalf of the American people, I want to extend my warmest 
congratulations to Ehud Barak upon his election as Israel's new Prime 
Minister. The people of Israel have given the new Prime Minister a 
strong mandate.
    I have just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu to thank him for 
his dedicated service to Israel. I also spoke with Prime Minister-elect 
Barak to congratulate him and reaffirm our Nation's steadfast support 
for Israel and its people. I will continue to work energetically for a 
just, lasting, and comprehensive peace that strengthens Israel's 
security. I look forward to working closely with Ehud Barak and his new 
government as they strive to reach that goal with their Palestinian and 
Arab partners.
