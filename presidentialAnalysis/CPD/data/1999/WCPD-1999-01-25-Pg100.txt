Remarks to an Overflow Crowd in Norristown, Pennsylvania

January 20, 1999

    Thank you very much. You know, I felt, even when I thought there 
were just a couple of hundred people here, I felt so badly for you 
having to wait and wait and wait.
    But let me tell you, you should know at least it is a lot cooler in 
here than it is in there. We have had a wonderful, wonderful time here. 
We are very grateful to all of you for coming out, for supporting your 
schools, supporting your communities, supporting your country, and we 
thank you so much. And of course, just personally, it's meant a great 
deal to Al and Tipper and to Hillary and me to see you here and see you 
so enthusiastic about the future.
    I want you to remember how you feel tonight, and I want you to keep 
it with you all year long. We've got a lot to do, and it's going to be 
good for America.
    God bless you.

Note: The President spoke at 8:58 p.m. in the auditorium at the 
Norristown Area High School. The transcript made available by the Office 
of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of Vice President Al 
Gore and Representative Joseph M. Hoeffel.
