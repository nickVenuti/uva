Statement on the Organization of African Unity's Framework Agreement for 
Ethiopia and Eritrea

July 27, 1999

    I welcome the announcement by the Organization of African Unity 
(OAU) that Ethiopia and Eritrea have accepted the OAU Framework 
Agreement and the Modalities for its implementation, and agreed to steps 
proposed by the OAU to facilitate implementation of the Agreement. This 
is a significant step toward peace.
    We have worked intensively with the OAU in recent weeks to help 
bring an end to this devastating conflict. My Special Envoy, 
Anthony Lake, has just returned from the region, where he met with the 
leaders of both governments and the OAU. The United States will continue 
to support the efforts of the OAU under the chairmanship of Algerian 
President Bouteflika to bring this tragic conflict to a speedy 
conclusion.
