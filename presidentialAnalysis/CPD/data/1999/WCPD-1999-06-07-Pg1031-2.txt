Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting Documentation on the 
Extension of Normal Trade Relations Status With Belarus

June 3, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''), with respect to the 
continuation of a waiver of the application of subsections (a) and (b) 
of section 402 of the Act. This document constitutes my recommendation 
to continue in effect this waiver for a further 12-month period, and 
includes my determination that continuation of the waiver currently in 
effect for the Republic of Belarus will substantially promote the 
objectives of section 402 of the Act. I will submit separate reports 
with respect to Vietnam and the People's Republic of China.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
