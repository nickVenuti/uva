Statement on a Meeting of the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan

February 22, 1999

    I welcome the successful meeting over the weekend between Indian 
Prime Minister Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif. I commend 
the two Prime Ministers for demonstrating courage and leadership by 
coming together and addressing difficult issues that have long divided 
their countries.
    The two leaders committed to intensifying their efforts on key 
matters, including: containing their competition in nuclear arms; 
preventing nuclear or conventional conflict between them; resolving 
territorial disputes including Jammu and Kashmir; refraining from 
interference in each other's internal affairs; fighting terrorism; 
promoting political freedom and human rights; and working together to 
improve the lives of their citizens through economic growth.
    South Asia--and, indeed, the entire world--will benefit if India and 
Pakistan promptly turn these commitments into concrete progress. We will 
continue our own efforts to work with India and Pakistan to promote 
progress in the region.
