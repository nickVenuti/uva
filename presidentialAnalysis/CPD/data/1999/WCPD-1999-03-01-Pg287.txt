Radio Remarks on the ``Insure Kids Now'' Initiative

February 23, 1999

    As every parent knows, nothing is more important than keeping our 
children healthy. So I have very good news for working parents. Even if 
you can't afford private health insurance, it's now possible to get help 
with doctor bills, medicines, and hospital care for your children. If 
your children are uninsured, please call 1-877-KIDS-NOW--1-877-KIDS-NOW. 
With a little help, your children can get the care they need to grow up 
healthy and strong.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 2:54 p.m. 
in the Oval Office on February 22 for later broadcast as a public 
service announcement. The transcript was released by the Office of the 
Press Secretary on February 23. A tape was not available for 
verification of the content of these remarks.
