Statement on the Surrender of the Suspected ``Railway Killer''

July 13, 1999

    I want to thank all of the State, local, and Federal law enforcement 
officials whose hard work led to the surrender of the 
suspected ``railway killer'' earlier today. As a result of their 
determined efforts and the cooperation of Mexican authorities, the 
suspect is now in custody in the United States. All Americans can rest 
easier knowing that law enforcement authorities will bring the full 
force of the law to bear in this case.
