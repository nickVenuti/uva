Statement on Measures Regarding Certain Liberians in the United States

September 27, 1999

    Today I directed the Attorney General and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to defer for one year from September 29 the 
deportation of certain Liberians who are present in the United States on 
that date. This action is aimed at promoting stability in Liberia and 
west Africa. In particular, I am concerned that a decision by our 
Government to deport Liberians who have enjoyed the protection of our 
country for many years

could cause governments in west Africa to deport many thousands of 
Liberians in their own countries. This would severely burden Liberia and 
threaten the fragile peace that has been recently achieved in west 
Africa. Furthermore, this action preserves the status quo for these 
Liberians while the Congress actively considers legislative relief for 
them.
