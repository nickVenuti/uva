Remarks on Departure From Clarksdale

July 6, 1999

New Markets Initiative

    I will be very brief. It's hot. You've waited for me a long time, 
and I appreciate it. I'm glad to be back here. I'm glad to be in the 
Delta. I'm glad to have brought business leaders from all over the 
country here today.
    We are trying to send a message to America that good people live 
here; they have not fully participated in this economic recovery that 
has swept our country and lifted up America's economy as strong as it's 
ever been. And we can't rest until every American who wants to work has 
a chance to get a good education, a good job, and raise a family in a 
strong community.
    And what we're proposing to do is simply to say to the investors of 
the country, take a look at the Delta, take a look at these other places 
in America that haven't grown as they should have, and we will give you 
the same tax and other incentives to invest in American new markets that 
we give you today to invest around the world. I think we ought to give 
people the same incentive to go to the Delta. That's the message--you 
help us get the message out.
    Good luck, God bless you, and thank you for making me feel welcome. 
Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 2:09 p.m. at Clarksdale Airport prior to
