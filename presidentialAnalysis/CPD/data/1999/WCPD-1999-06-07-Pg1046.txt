Statement on South Africa's National Election

June 4, 1999

    It is my great pleasure to congratulate President Nelson Mandela and 
the people of South Africa for Wednesday's successful national 
elections.
    It has been my honor and privilege to work with my great and 
courageous friend, President Mandela, during the past 5 years as he and 
his fellow citizens have worked to heal the wounds of the past and build 
a new, inclusive, democratic, and free South Africa. The elections 
Wednesday represent an important step on that continuing journey. Their 
peaceful and fair conduct and the tremendous voter turnout are a 
testament to South Africa's extraordinary transformation. I congratulate 
all the parties and candidates who participated.
    And on behalf of all Americans, I congratulate the people of South 
Africa for their determination and hard work to build a better future. 
By doing so, South Africa has reminded us of the preciousness of 
democracy and the resilience of the human spirit. South Africa's example 
shows the way forward for other troubled areas of the world, from Kosovo 
to the Middle East to Kashmir--inclusive, democratic government that 
represents the will of the people can be a bulwark against conflict and 
a foundation for reconciliation, cooperation, and lasting peace. We will 
continue to work in partnership with South Africa to build a world of 
justice and tolerance, opportunity and prosperity, democracy and 
security.
