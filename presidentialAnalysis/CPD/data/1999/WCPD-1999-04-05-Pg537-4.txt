Message on the Observance of Passover, 1999

March 30, 1999

    Warm greetings to all those observing Passover.

journey through the desert was long and difficult, but they were guided 
by the light of their faith and sustained by their dream of liberty. 
When at last they arrived in the Promised Land, they rejoiced in their 
freedom to worship God, to rebuild their communities, and to raise their 
children in the traditions and beliefs of the Jewish religion.
    As a people who have always cherished the values of faith and 
freedom, all Americans can draw inspiration from the story of Passover. 
It reminds us of our ongoing journey to build our own Promised Land, 
where all people are free to worship according to their conscience and 
where our children can grow up safe from the shadows of intolerance and 
oppression.
    As families across the nation and around the world gather to 
remember the liberation of the Israelites and to teach a new generation 
the ancient tradition of the Passover Seder and the reading of the 
Haggadah, let us all give thanks for God's sustaining love and for the 
Jewish heritage that has so strengthened and enriched our national life.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes for a joyous Passover 
celebration.
