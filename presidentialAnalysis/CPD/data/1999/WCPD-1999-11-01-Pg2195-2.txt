Message to the Senate Transmitting the Ireland-United States Tax 
Convention and Documentation

October 29, 1999

To the Senate of the United States:

    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Amending the Convention Between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of Ireland for the Avoidance 
of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to 
Taxes on Income and Capital Gains signed at Dublin on July 28, 1997. The 
Convention, which was negotiated pursuant to the Senate's resolution of 
October 31, 1997, granting advice and consent to the 1997 Convention, 
modifies the tax treatment of dividends received from Real Estate 
Investment Trusts.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
October 29, 1999.
