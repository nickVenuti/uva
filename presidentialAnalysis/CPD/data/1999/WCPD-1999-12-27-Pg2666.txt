Christmas Greeting to the Nation

December 24, 1999

    The President. On this holiest of holidays, Hillary and I would like 
to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas. This is a season of joy, a 
time for family and friends to rejoice in one another's company and in 
the magic of Christmas.
    The First Lady. At the dawn of this new millennium, let us reflect 
on our hopes, our dreams, and the gifts we can give to the future. Let 
us all cherish the gift of every child among us and pledge to build a 
world worthy of all our children.
    The President. May the spirit of the season be with you today and 
throughout the new year. From our family to yours, Merry Christmas, 
Happy New Year, may God bless you all.
