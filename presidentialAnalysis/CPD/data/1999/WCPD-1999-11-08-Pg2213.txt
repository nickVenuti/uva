Statement on Naming a Guided Missile Destroyer in Honor of the Late 
Senator John H. Chafee

October 30, 1999

    I am honored to announce today that the 40th ship of the Arleigh 
Burke class of guided missile destroyers will be named in honor of the 
late Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island. Senator Chafee 
distinguished himself throughout a life dedicated to serving our Nation 
as a United States Senator, as Secretary of the Navy, as Governor of 
Rhode Island, and as a United States Marine in World War II and the 
Korean war. Given Senator Chafee's long association with the sea--with 
the Marine Corps, the Navy, and the great maritime State of Rhode 
Island--I can think of no better way to honor his many contributions 
than to name a warship in his honor.
    The ship named in honor of Senator Chafee will be one of the most 
technologically advanced ships in the United States Navy. It will be 
capable of performing a wide range of missions in support of U.S. 
national security. Whether showing the flag in peacetime to build good 
will with other nations or employing its potent combat power in 
conflict, the ship will carry on Senator Chafee's legacy of honorable 
service to our Nation.
