Statement on the Middle East Peace Process

September 3, 1999

    I am extremely pleased that the leaders of Israel and the PLO have 
reached an agreement that will allow them to resume implementation of 
the Wye River accords and restart permanent status talks on an 
accelerated basis. I congratulate the two leaders for their vision in 
seizing this opportunity. It shows that when both sides are willing to 
work together, their fundamental requirements can be met, confidence can 
be built, and the process can move forward.
    I thank the Egyptian Government, especially my good friend President 
Hosni
Mubarak, for helping to facilitate the agreement. I am grateful to 
Secretary of State Albright and her team. Their personal involvement 
made the difference in helping the two sides to bridge remaining gaps 
and reach consensus.
    This truly is a new beginning. A lasting, just, and comprehensive 
peace in the Middle East is now a step closer. The Israelis and 
Palestinians are doing their part to bring it about. We must do ours. 
Today I call on the Congress to fund fully the commitments we made when 
the Wye accords were first signed.
