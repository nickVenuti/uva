            in amounts in excess of funds otherwise available for such 
            assistance is important to the national interests of the 
            United States; and,
(2)         such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision 
            of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
    Therefore, I direct the drawdown of up to $5 million in commodities 
and services from the inventory and resources of the Department of 
Defense for the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.
    The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this 
determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the 
Federal Register.
