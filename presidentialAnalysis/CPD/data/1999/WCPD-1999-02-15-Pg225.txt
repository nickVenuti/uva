Remarks on the Conclusion of the Senate Impeachment Trial and an 
Exchange With Reporters

February 12, 1999

    The President. Now that the Senate has fulfilled its constitutional 
responsibility, bringing this process to a conclusion, I want to say 
again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am for what I said 
and did to trigger these events and the great burden they have imposed 
on the Congress and on the American people.
    I also am humbled and very grateful for the support and the prayers 
I have received from millions of Americans over this past year.
    Now I ask all Americans, and I hope all Americans--here in 
Washington and throughout our land--will rededicate ourselves to the 
work of serving our Nation and building our future together. This can be 
and this must be a time of reconciliation and renewal for America.
    Thank you very much.

Forgiveness

    Q. In your heart, sir, can you forgive and forget?
    The President. I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to 
be prepared to give it.

Note: The President spoke at 2:38 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House.
