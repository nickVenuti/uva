Statement on the Resignation of Janet Yellen as Chair of the Council of 
Economic Advisers

June 8, 1999

    I am sorry to learn that Dr. Janet Yellen intends to resign as Chair 
of the Council of Economic Advisers. Her extraordinary intellect and 
keen grasp of domestic and international economics have contributed 
enormously to the formation of my administration's policies in critical 
areas ranging from Social Security, health care, and the budget to trade 
and international financial architecture. Janet has been a consistent 
advocate for sound economic policy, and she has been an important 
contributor to the extraordinary economic progress we have made in 
recent years. I wish her and George the very best as they return to 
private life.
