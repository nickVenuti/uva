Statement on Announcement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina National Day

September 1, 1999

    Today the Joint Presidents of Bosnia-Herzegovina announced that the 
national day of their country will henceforth be celebrated on November 
21, the anniversary of the
Dayton peace accords of 1995. In so doing, the leaders of every ethnic 
community in Bosnia-Herzegovina have made clear that Dayton marked not 
merely the end of a war but the beginning of a new country and a 
blueprint for its future. I am pleased that the date
November 21 will be honored as a symbol of multi-ethnic democracy and 
solidarity between the people of the United States and the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
