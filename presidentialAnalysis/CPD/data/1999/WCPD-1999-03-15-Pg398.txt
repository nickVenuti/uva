Radio Remarks on Proposed Airline Passenger Protection Legislation

March 10, 1999

    Our country's airlines serve millions of Americans a year, but as 
more planes are taking off, so are passenger complaints. That's why I'm 
proposing a new law requiring all airlines to spell out how they will 
address problems such as delays, overbooking, and missing baggage. This 
airline passenger protection act has overwhelming bipartisan support. 
With its passage, we can make the best airline system in the world even 
better.
