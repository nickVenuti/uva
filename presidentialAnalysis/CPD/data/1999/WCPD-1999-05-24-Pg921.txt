Statement on National Crime Statistics

May 16, 1999

    Today the FBI released preliminary data showing that crime fell 
another 7 percent in 1998, with an 8 percent decline in murder and an 11 
percent decline in robbery. Crime is now down for a remarkable seventh 
year in a row. More community police on our streets and fewer guns in 
the hands of criminals have helped make our communities the safest they 
have been in a generation.
    But tragic events like the Littleton shooting remind us that our 
work is far from done. We in Washington have a responsibility to support 
law enforcement officers and pass commonsense gun legislation. We should 
start by closing the gun show loophole that allows criminals and 
juveniles to buy guns

at gun shows without so much as a background check. In this way, we can 
keep the crime rates coming down.
