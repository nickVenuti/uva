Statement on the Earthquake in Taiwan

September 20, 1999

    Hillary and I were saddened by news of injuries and deaths sustained 
by the people on Taiwan as a result of a major earthquake today. Our 
thoughts are with all of those who have suffered losses and who may 
still be in need of assistance. We are in touch directly with the Taiwan 
authorities to determine what assistance from the United States may be 
needed.
