Statement on the Cease-Fire Agreement in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo

July 12, 1999

    I salute the leaders of Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(DROC), Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe for their courage and 
commitment to peace in agreeing to the terms for a cease-fire in the 
Congo war. The signing of this agreement in Lusaka on July 10 provides 
hope for the many innocent civilians who have suffered

through one of Africa's most dangerous and divisive wars in modern 
times.
    Zambian President Chiluba also deserves special tribute for his role 
in mediating and facilitating the Lusaka peace talks, and for his 
continuing efforts to urge rebel factions to support the cease-fire 
agreement. I urge all rebel groups to commit to peace and sign on to 
this important accord.
    We have worked with all parties to encourage the resolution of their 
differences through dialog and negotiations. We will work closely with 
our partners in Africa, the international community, and the United 
Nations to support this agreement. We hope that its full implementation, 
including the disarming of those responsible for the Rwandan genocide, 
will end the cycle of violence in the region, pave the way for an 
inclusive democracy in the DROC, and help bring a better life for all 
the people of central Africa.
