Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on the Emigration Policies 
and Trade Status of Mongolia

February 11, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:

    On September 4, 1996, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Mongolia was not in violation of the freedom of emigration criteria of 
sections 402(a) and 409(a) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. This 
action allowed for the continuation of normal trade relations status for 
Mongolia and certain other activities without the requirement of an 
annual waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the 
Congress concerning

the emigration laws and policies of Mongolia. The report indicates 
continued Mongolian compliance with U.S. and international standards in 
the area of emigration.
