President Menem

    President Clinton. Well, we want to say, first of all, thank you to 
our wonderful musicians, our magnificent dancers. I will never look at 
you again in quite the same way, Robert. [Laughter]
    We are very grateful to you, and I hope, Mr. President, you feel a 
little more at home. Thank you, again.

House. In his remarks, he referred to actor Robert Duvall. The
