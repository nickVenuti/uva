Statement on the Proposed ``Southeast Europe Trade Preference Act''

November 12, 1999

    Today I instructed the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative to transmit to Congress the ``Southeast Europe Trade 
Preference Act'' (``SETPA''), which would authorize expansion of duty-
free treatment to a much broader range of imports from the region for 5 
years. This legislation implements in part a trade expansion initiative 
that I launched at the Sarajevo Summit in July. This initiative is an 
important part of the broader Stability Pact developed by the United 
States, our European allies and partners, and others to speed the 
economic development and democratization of southeast Europe and advance 
its integration into an undivided Europe. Along with trade benefits 
provided by European nations, these efforts can help the countries of 
the region achieve long-term economic growth. This, in turn, will 
strengthen the region's stability and reduce the risk of another 
destructive conflict.
