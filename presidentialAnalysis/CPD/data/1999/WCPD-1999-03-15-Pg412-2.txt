Statement on House Action To Support Use of United States Armed 
Forces in Kosovo

March 11, 1999

    I am pleased with the House vote which demonstrates the broad, 
bipartisan support for our efforts to bring peace to Kosovo. This vote 
sends a clear message to both parties that it is time now to sign an 
agreement that stops the fighting in Kosovo and creates real self-
government for the Kosovar people. The vote confirms the strong 
commitment of the United States to continue our efforts to provide the 
leadership necessary to bring about a peaceful resolution to this 
conflict.
