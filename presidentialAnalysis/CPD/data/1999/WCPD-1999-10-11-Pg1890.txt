Statement on the Fire at the Department of Commerce

October 1, 1999

    I am relieved that today's fire at the Department of Commerce was 
extinguished quickly and apparently without any serious injuries. The DC 
Fire Department and all those who worked to put out the fire deserve 
credit for ensuring the safety of the Department of Commerce employees 
who work at the Herbert Hoover Building. I hope that the damage can be 
repaired quickly and that Secretary Daley and his entire team can be 
back to full speed as soon as possible.
