of the Palestinian Authority in Oslo

November 1, 1999

EgyptAir Flight 990 Aircraft Tragedy

    Q. Mr. President, is there anything new on the crash, sir? Has the 
Pentagon radar or satellite imagery been able to yield any clues as to 
what happened to EgyptAir 990?
    President Clinton. Nothing that I've been briefed on.

Middle East Peace Process

    Q. Mr. Chairman, what would you like the President to do to be 
helpful to your aspirations, as you put it?
    Chairman Arafat. Not to forget that first agreement which had been 
started here in Oslo had been signed under his supervision in the White 
House. We cannot forget it.

Note: The exchange began at 5:52 p.m. in the Gamlebyen Room at the SAS 
Radisson Hotel. A tape was not available for verification of the content
