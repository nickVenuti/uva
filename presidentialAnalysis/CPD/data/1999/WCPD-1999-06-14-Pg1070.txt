Statement on the Military Technical Agreement on Kosovo

June 9, 1999

    The agreement reached today by NATO and Serbian military officials 
is another important step toward achieving our objectives in Kosovo. It 
lays out the details to meet the essential conditions for peace: the 
rapid, orderly withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo and the 
deployment of an international security force, with NATO at its core, 
which means a unified NATO chain of command, so that Kosovars can return 
home safely. We and our Allies will watch carefully to see whether the 
Serb forces are peacefully leaving Kosovo in accordance with the agreed 
timetable. We have made clear to the leaders of the Kosovo Liberation 
Army that we expect them not to hinder the Serb withdrawal.

Note: The statement referred to the Military Technical Agreement Between 
the International Security Force (KFOR) and the Governments of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia.
