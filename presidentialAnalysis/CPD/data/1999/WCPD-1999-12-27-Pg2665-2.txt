Statement on the Death of Tom Henderson

December 23, 1999

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Tom 
Henderson, a member of my Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS and a senior 
staff person at the Environmental Protection Agency. Tom was a longtime 
friend to both of us and combined great intelligence with a sharp Texas 
wit. He was a strong and effective advocate for our efforts to combat 
AIDS, the disease that eventually took his life. We will miss Tom, as 
will members of the Council, his colleagues at the EPA and the White 
House, and the hundreds of people around the country who were blessed to 
know him as a friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his partner 
Michael, his daughter Melissa, and all of those like us who grieve his 
loss.
