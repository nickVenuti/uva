Statement on the Conclusion of the Independent Counsel's Investigation 
of Henry G. Cisneros

September 7, 1999

    Henry has been a dedicated public official who served the American 
people and this administration with distinction. He is also a good 
friend. I am pleased that this matter is finally behind him, and I wish 
him and his family all the best.
