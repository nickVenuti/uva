Excerpt From an Interview With Judith Miller and William Broad of the 
New York Times

January 21, 1999

Senator Dale Bumpers' Senate Impeachment Trial Presentation

    Q. We're about to go. Did you have a chance to watch any of Senator 
Bumpers' presentation today?
    The President. I did. It's the only thing I've watched. I watched 
that.
    Q. He said--he criticized the House managers for lacking compassion 
for your family. He described your family as a family that has been 
``about as decimated as a family can get. The relationship between 
husband and wife, father and child, has been incredibly strained if not 
destroyed.'' Is that an accurate representation?
    The President. Well, it's been--I would say it has been a strain for 
my family. But we have worked very hard, and I think we have come 
through the worst. We love each other very much, and we've worked on it 
very hard. But I think he was showing--you know, he knows me and Hillary 
and Chelsea, and we've all been friends, as he said, for 25 years. I 
think he was just trying to inject a human element into what he was 
saying.
