Statement on Senate Action To Block Campaign Finance Reform Legislation

October 19, 1999

    Once again, a minority in the Senate has blocked bipartisan campaign 
finance reform. The failure of the Senate to adopt real reform is a 
victory for the politics of cynicism, and it leaves unchecked the 
influence of moneyed special interests. I will not let the Senate's 
inaction deter us from our goal, which is to restore the public's faith 
in our political system. That is why I will continue to fight for 
passage of real, comprehensive campaign finance reform like that passed 
recently by the House. The people of this country want reform, and the 
Senate cannot stand in their way forever.
