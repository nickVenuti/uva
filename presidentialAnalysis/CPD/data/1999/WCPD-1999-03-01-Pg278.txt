Statement on Industry and Education Leaders' Recommendations on 
Technology 
in the Classroom

February 22, 1999

    I am delighted that the CEO Forum on Education and Technology, a 
group of leaders from industry and education, has developed a strong set 
of recommendations to ensure that teachers can effectively use 
technology in the classroom. If technology is to realize its potential 
as a powerful new tool to help students achieve high academic standards, 
teachers must be as comfortable with a computer as they are with a 
chalkboard.
    That is why my $800 million budget for educational technology 
includes over $100 million to give both new and current teachers the 
training they need to integrate technology into the curriculum. I look 
forward to working with the CEO forum and other leaders in industry and 
education to give every child and teacher in America access to these 
high-tech tools for learning.
