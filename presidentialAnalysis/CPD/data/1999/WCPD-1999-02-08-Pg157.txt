    I have always had confidence that Harold Ickes acted lawfully and 
appropriately, and I am pleased by the decision announced by the 
Attorney General today. Harold's contributions to this administration 
over the years have helped improve the quality of life in this country, 
and I will always be thankful for his advice and hard work on behalf of 
the American people.
