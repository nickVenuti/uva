Statement on Transmitting the Montreal Protocol on Substances That 
Deplete the Ozone Layer to the Senate

September 16, 1999

    Today, on the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone 
Layer, I am transmitting to the Senate for its advice and consent an 
amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone 
Layer.
    Preservation of the ozone layer is critical to life on Earth. The 
Montreal Protocol has led to a dramatic reduction in the production and 
use of ozone-depleting chemicals, and scientists report that the ozone 
layer is on its way to recovery. The amendment I transmit today builds 
on this progress, in part by strengthening measures to promote 
compliance with the Protocol. I urge the Senate to approve this 
amendment.
    It also is critical that the United States support efforts by 
developing countries to phase out their use of ozone-depleting 
chemicals. Regrettably, appropriations measures now before Congress 
would deny funds I have requested for the Montreal Protocol Fund, which 
has a long record of success in these efforts. I call on Congress to 
approve the funds needed to help preserve the Earth's protective ozone 
layer.
