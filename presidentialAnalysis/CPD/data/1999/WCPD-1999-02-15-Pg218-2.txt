Statement on the Nomination of Richard C. Holbrooke to be Ambassador to 
the United Nations

February 9, 1999

and diplomatic skills have significantly advanced the values and 
interests of the American people.
    At a time when international crises, from Iraq to Kosovo, demand the

our U.N. Ambassador. He is extraordinarily well qualified for this vital 
position, and I look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of his 
nomination.
