Subject: Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the

    Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance 
Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that 
it is important to the national interest that up to $40 million be made 
available from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund 
to meet the unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs, including 
those of refugees, displaced persons, conflict victims, and other 
persons at risk, due to the Timor and North Caucasus crises. These funds 
may be used, as appropriate, to provide contributions to international, 
governmental, and non-governmental organizations.
    You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees 
of the Congress of this determination and the use of funds under this 
authority, and to arrange for the publication of this determination in 
the Federal Register.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton
