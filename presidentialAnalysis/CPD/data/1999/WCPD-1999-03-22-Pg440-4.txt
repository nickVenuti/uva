Statement on the Cuban Government's Sentencing
of Human Rights Activists

March 15, 1999

    I am deeply disappointed that the Cuban Government has sentenced 
four courageous human rights activists--Vladimiro Roca, Felix Bonne, 
Rene Gomez Manzano, and Marta Beatriz Roque--to prison terms. They did 
nothing more than assert their right to speak freely about their 
country's future, call on their Government to respect basic human 
rights, and seek a peaceful transition to democracy for the long-
suffering Cuban people. They were tried without a fair process, behind 
closed doors. I call on the Cuban Government to release them 
immediately.
