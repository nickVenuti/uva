Statement on the Death of Michael Hooker

June 29, 1999

    I was saddened to learn of the death of University of North Carolina 
Chancellor Michael Hooker. Michael Hooker devoted his life to improving 
higher education, not only in North Carolina but all over America. As 
chancellor of UNC, he was committed to building the best educational and 
cultural climate for students, while deepening the university's 
commitment to North Carolina and its economic future. His devotion led 
him to visit every county in North Carolina to discuss new ways of 
developing educational opportunity, and to encourage more people to 
participate in the educational system. I am especially grateful for his 
role in helping Education Secretary Riley implement our America Reads 
challenge, which enlists college students as tutors to help elementary 
students learn to read.
    Michael Hooker represented the very best in our education system, 
and the very best in public service. He will be missed. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with his wife, Carmen, and his daughter and grandchildren.
