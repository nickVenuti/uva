Statement on Robert E. Rubin's Acceptance of the Chairman of the Board 
Position at the Local Initiatives Support Corporation

September 16, 1999

    I am pleased that Bob Rubin has accepted the job as Chairman of the 
Board of LISC. This service is consistent with his longstanding 
commitment to bring economic opportunities to America's most underserved 
communities. His selection is not only a tremendous boost for LISC but 
also for those who advocate community economic development to ensure 
that all Americans share in our economic prosperity.
