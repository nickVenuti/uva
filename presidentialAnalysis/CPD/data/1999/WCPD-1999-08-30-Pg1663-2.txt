Statement on the Counterdrug Operations at Miami International Airport

August 25, 1999

    I want to congratulate law enforcement officials for the successful 
counterdrug operations that resulted today in numerous indictments for 
violations of our Federal drug laws. This joint initiative required the 
hard work of the DEA, U.S. Customs Service, ATF, and local law 
enforcement agencies. It is a product of our shared determination to 
shield American borders from the drug threat. The efforts of this team 
show that by working together, we can reduce the flow of drugs into our 
Nation and fight drug-related crime and violence. From the recent 
decline in youth drug use, to the law enforcement success of today's 
investigations, our balanced and
comprehensive national antidrug strategy is producing real results for 
the American people.
