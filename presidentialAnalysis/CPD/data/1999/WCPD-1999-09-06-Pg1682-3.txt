Statement on the Release of the ``Futurework'' Report

September 1, 1999

    The ``Futurework'' report, released today by the Department of 
Labor, underscores the need for an even stronger commitment to education 
and training to help workers thrive in an economy that is changing 
faster than ever before. Now, more than ever, American workers must 
learn the new skills needed to face the challenges of the 21st century 
economy.
    The Republican tax proposal, because it would force cuts in 
education and worker training of roughly 50 percent in 2009, would deny 
millions of Americans the chance to gain these skills. Now is not the 
time to shortchange the future opportunities of American workers by 
enacting an irresponsible tax plan that fails to allow adequate 
investment in education and training.
