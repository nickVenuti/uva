Radio Remarks on the Observance of Independence Day, 1999

July 2, 1999

    This weekend, as we celebrate the 223d anniversary of the 
Declaration of Independence and the birthday of our great Nation, let us 
reflect on what it means to be an American.
    Let us remember the visionaries, the patriots, and the soldiers who 
were inspired by a single ideal, that we are all created equal. And let 
us strive to honor that ideal today and every day by building a world 
where every individual can make the most of his or her talents and know 
what it truly means to live and breathe free.
    On this, the last Independence Day of the 20th century, Hillary and 
I wish you a happy and memorable Fourth of July.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 1 p.m. on 
June 29 in the Cabinet Room at the White House for later broadcast on 
the Fourth of July. The transcript was released by the Office of the 
Press Secretary on July 2. These remarks were also made available on the
