Statement on the Tourist Boat Tragedy in Hot Springs, Arkansas

May 3, 1999

    Hillary and I were heartbroken to hear this weekend of the 13 people 
killed when a tourist boat sank in my hometown of Hot Springs, Arkansas. 
I know Lake Hamilton well, and I am terribly saddened that this 
beautiful lake has become the site of such a tragedy. I commend all 
those Hot Springs residents who worked courageously to save lives in the 
moments after the sinking. Hillary and I send our thoughts, prayers, and 
deepest sympathies to all those families mourning their loved ones. As 
it is written in the Bible, God ``will not in any way fail you, nor give 
you up, nor leave you without support.''
