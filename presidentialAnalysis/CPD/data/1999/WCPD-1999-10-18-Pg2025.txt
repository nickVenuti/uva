Statement on the Military Coup d'Etat in Pakistan

October 13, 1999

    The events in Pakistan this week represent another setback to 
Pakistani democracy. Pakistan's interests would be served by a prompt 
return to civilian rule and restoration of the democratic process. I 
urge that Pakistan move quickly in that direction.
    I am sending my Ambassador back to Islamabad to underscore my view 
directly to the military authorities and to hear their intentions. I 
will also be consulting closely with all concerned nations about 
maintaining peace and stability in South Asia.
