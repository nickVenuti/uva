States is lifting our ban on direct flights to Murtala Muhammed Airport 
in Lagos, 
Nigeria.
    I congratulate President Obasanjo and his government for taking the 
steps necessary to remove this ban, including the overhauling of

governance. They offer new evidence that Nigeria is reversing the damage 
that years of corruption and mismanagement inflicted upon its

    I am deeply gratified to see a government chosen by the Nigerian 
people earning the trust and respect of the world. I look forward to 
strengthening our partnership with Nigeria even further over the coming 
year.

Note: In his statement, the President referred to President Olusegun 
Obasanjo of Nigeria.
