Statement on Senate Action on Steel Imports Limitation Legislation

June 22, 1999

    Today's vote is a reaffirmation of America's commitment to open 
markets, to a strong U.S. economy, and to vigorous enforcement of our 
trade laws. The surge in steel imports has created significant hardship 
for many steelworkers and communities. But quota legislation was the 
wrong approach and would have weakened our economy and undermined our 
ability to tear down unfair trade barriers in foreign countries that 
hurt our workers, farmers, and companies. We must and will continue 
vigorous enforcement of our trade laws. Our actions have already cut 
imports to pre-crisis levels. I will continue to work with workers, 
industry, and Members of Congress to attack unfair trade practices and 
subsidies around the world.
