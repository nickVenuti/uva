Radio Remarks on Disaster Relief Provisions in the 1999 Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations Act

May 20, 1999

    On behalf of the many thousands of citizens struggling to put their 
lives back together following the recent string of devastating 
tornadoes, I want to thank the Congress for its approval of the 
supplemental budget. Some $900 million in funding will go immediately to 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to ensure there will be no 
interruption in assistance to the disaster victims in Oklahoma, Kansas, 
Tennessee, Texas, and other States.
    Vice President Gore and I saw the devastation first hand. We know 
that many families lost not only loved ones but also everything they 
own. All these families remain in our prayers. And we want them to know 
that their Government will continue to be there for them throughout 
their time of need.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 6:30 p.m. 
in the Oval Office on May 19 for later broadcast. The transcript was 
released by the Office of the Press Secretary on May 20. These remarks 
were also made available on the White House Press Office Actuality Line. 
A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
