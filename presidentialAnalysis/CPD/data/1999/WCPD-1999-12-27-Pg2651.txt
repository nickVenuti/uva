celebration in our Nation's Capital to ring in a new year, new century, 
new millennium. Join us in honoring our past and imagining the future, 
by kicking off the celebration at 11:00 a.m. on December 31st with an 
opening ceremony at the Main Street Millennium stage at 12th and

Smithsonian museums, and food and fun at the city's block party.
    Usher in the year 2000 at America's Millennium Gala at the Lincoln 
Memorial, beginning at 9:00 p.m. It will include a stirring concert, a 
premiere of a film on the 20th century by Steven Spielberg, and a
