Notice--Continuation of Sudanese Emergency

October 29, 1999

    On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by 
the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan. By Executive Order 
13067, I imposed trade sanctions on Sudan and blocked Sudanese 
government assets. Because the Government of Sudan has continued its 
activities hostile to United States interests, the national emergency 
declared on November 3, 1997, and the measures adopted on that date to 
deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond November 3, 
1999. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national 
emergency for 1 year with respect to Sudan.
    This notice shall be published in the
Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
