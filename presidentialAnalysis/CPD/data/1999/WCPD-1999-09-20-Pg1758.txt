Statement on the Announcement of the Gates Millennium Scholarships

September 16, 1999

    I applaud the leadership and foresight shown by the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation today with its $1 billion pledge to provide full 
college scholarships for minority students in the fields of education, 
math, science, and engineering. These landmark scholarships will help 
address important needs: the need to encourage young people to become 
teachers, the need to ensure that our children are well-prepared in math 
and science, and the need to open the doors of higher learning to all 
students. The Gates Millennium Scholarships remind us what vital role 
philanthropies can play in American life and how urgent it is for all of 
us to invest now in our Nation's young people.
