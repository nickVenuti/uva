Statement on the Murder of Neelan Thiruchelvam

July 30, 1999

    Hillary and I were shocked and saddened by the tragic death of 
Neelan Thiruchelvam at the hands of terrorists in Sri Lanka today. We 
extend our deepest condolences to his wife and family.

    Neelan Thiruchelvam was a constitutional lawyer and human rights 
advocate who was well-known and well-respected far beyond his country. 
He devoted himself to seeking a peaceful and just solution to the tragic 
conflict that has caused so much bloodshed in Sri Lanka.
    Hillary was deeply moved by her meeting with Mr. Thiruchelvam during 
her 1995 visit to Sri Lanka. With his death, a powerful voice for 
reconciliation in Sri Lanka has been silenced. I hope that this tragedy 
will spur efforts to find an end to the fighting and to build a lasting 
peace in Sri Lanka.
