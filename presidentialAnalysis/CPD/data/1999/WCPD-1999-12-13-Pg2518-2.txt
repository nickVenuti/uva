Statement on the Fire at the Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse 
Company

December 4, 1999

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the tragedy that has 
struck the Worcester community. The six firefighters who are now missing 
and presumed dead valiantly put their lives on the line in the effort to 
save others and protect their city. Their courageous service reminds us 
all of the tremendous commitment and sacrifice made by the thousands of 
firefighters across America who risk their own lives every day to 
protect our communities. Our thoughts and prayers go out to these 
courageous firefighters, to their families, to the Worcester Fire 
Department, and the city of Worcester.
