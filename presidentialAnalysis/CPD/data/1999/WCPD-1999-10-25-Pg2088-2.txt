Statement on the Vote in Indonesia To Accept the East Timor Referendum 
Results

October 19, 1999

    I welcome the historic decision by the People's Consultative 
Assembly of Indonesia to accept the results of the August 30 referendum 
in East Timor. The assembly's unequivocal action shows respect for the 
will of the people of East Timor. It is also an important step forward 
in Indonesia's own democratic transformation, which the United States 
strongly supports.
    Of course, much work remains to make sure that East Timor's 
transition succeeds. In the wake of the assembly's decision, the United 
Nations must establish a transition administration leading to East 
Timor's full independence. And Indonesia must take the necessary steps 
to ensure the safe return of all displaced East Timorese, including 
allowing the international community full access to displaced persons in 
west Timor.
    The United States is committed to helping the people of East Timor 
not only obtain the legal recognition of independence but also develop 
the institutions they need to thrive as an independent state. We are 
equally determined to help Indonesia achieve its goal of lasting 
democracy and prosperity. Today's action will bring both goals closer to 
fruition.
