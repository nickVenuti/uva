Statement on a Serbian Proposal To Settle the Situation in Kosovo

March 30, 1999

    I share the view of Chancellor Schroeder that President Milosevic's 
proposal is unacceptable. President Milosevic began this brutal 
campaign. It is his responsibility to bring it to an immediate end and 
embrace a just peace. There is a strong consensus in NATO that we must 
press forward with our military action.
