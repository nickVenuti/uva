Statement on Senate Action on Juvenile Crime and Gun Legislation

July 28, 1999

    Today, after weeks of partisan delay, the Senate finally appointed 
conferees on juvenile crime and gun legislation. While I am heartened by 
this modest progress, more than 3 months have passed since the tragedy 
at Columbine, and Congress has yet to send me a bill to make commonsense 
gun reforms the law of the land. I challenge the House to follow the 
Senate's lead and appoint conferees before the August recess, so that 
the full Congress can get back to work and pass a bill with strong gun 
provisions as our children go back to school.
