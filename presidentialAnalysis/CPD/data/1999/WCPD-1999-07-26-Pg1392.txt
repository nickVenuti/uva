Statement on House Action on the Proposed ``African Growth and 
Opportunity Act''

July 16, 1999

    I welcome and applaud passage today by the House of Representatives 
of the ``African Growth and Opportunity Act.'' This historic initiative 
will set the foundation for a stronger partnership between the United 
States and Africa. I urge the Senate to act quickly so that we can 
strengthen the ties between our Nation and a continent on the verge of a 
new era of democracy and prosperity.
    This legislation offers the opportunity for increased trade and 
investment between the United States and Africa--to the mutual benefit 
of both. By working with African nations to build their economies, 
strengthen democratic government, and increase opportunities for all the 
people of Africa, we will help build strong, capable partners with whom 
we can work to counter the growing threats of terrorism, crime, 
environmental degradation, and disease.
