Radio Remarks on the Philadelphia Shipyard

April 9, 1999

    Last week the U.S. Navy and Philadelphia signed several important 
agreements that are good for the city, the Navy, and our Nation.

I want to thank Mayor Rendell, the people of the United States Navy, and 
others who were critical to this important achievement. These 
agreements, combined with the decision by the Norwegian company Kvaerner 
to invest here, will help transform Philadelphia's huge and historic 
naval shipyard, generating thousands of high paying jobs, helping to 
revitalize America's commercial shipbuilding industry. Working together, 
this remarkable partnership of business, labor, and Government will 
modernize the shipyard and train workers to produce state-of-the-art 
commercial ships. Congratulations to the people of Philadelphia on an 
important new economic venture.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 12:30 p.m. 
in the administrative offices of Memorial Hall in Philadelphia, PA, for 
later broadcast. In his remarks, he referred to Mayor Edward Rendell of 
Philadelphia. The remarks were also made available on the White House 
Press Radio Actuality Line.
