Message to the Senate Transmitting the Paraguay-United States 
Extradition Treaty

July 13, 1999

To the Senate of the United States:

    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Republic of Paraguay, signed at Washington on 
November 9, 1998.
    In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the 
report states, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
    Upon entry into force, this Treaty would enhance cooperation between 
the law enforcement authorities of both countries, and thereby make a 
significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. The 
Treaty would supersede the Extradition Treaty between the United States 
of America and the Republic of Paraguay signed at Asuncion on May 24, 
1973.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
July 13, 1999.
