Statement on the Kennedy-Murray Amendment to Proposed Education 
Flexibility Partnership Legislation

March 8, 1999

    The Republican leadership continues to block a vote on an amendment 
to finish the job of hiring 100,000 teachers to reduce class size. 
Communities across the country need to know that Congress will live up 
to the bipartisan commitment we made last fall to fund this effort. The 
American people expect us to work together to improve the education of 
our students. I call on the Republican leadership to allow an up-or-down 
vote on more teachers and smaller classes.
