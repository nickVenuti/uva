Statement on Patients' Bill of Rights Legislation

August 5, 1999

    With today's announcement led by Drs. Ganske and Norwood and 
Congressman

[[Page 1566]]

Dingell, it is clear that there is now a bipartisan majority of House 
Members ready to vote for a strong and enforceable Patients' Bill of 
Rights. Unlike the partisan Senate-passed bill, this bipartisan 
initiative is a Patients' Bill of Rights not just in name but in 
reality. It provides meaningful patient protections to all Americans in 
all health plans, and it holds plans accountable when their actions 
cause harm to patients.
    Today's action proves that patient protections need not and should 
not be a partisan issue. It is time to do what this bipartisan coalition 
has done--put the well-being of patients before politics and special 
interests. I call on Speaker Hastert to schedule a vote on this long-
overdue legislation immediately upon return from the congressional 
recess in September.
