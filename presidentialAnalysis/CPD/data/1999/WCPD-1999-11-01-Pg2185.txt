Statement on the Crash of Navy Blue Angels

October 28, 1999

    I am deeply saddened that today America lost two of its bravest and 
most distinguished Naval aviators in a tragic crash of a Navy jet 
belonging to the Blue Angels.
    As a nation we all owe our military service-members a tremendous 
debt of gratitude.
    At this time of great loss--a loss that we all share--my heartfelt 
prayers go to their families, their shipmates, and to the entire Navy.
