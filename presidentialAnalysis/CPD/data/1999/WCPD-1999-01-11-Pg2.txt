Statement on the Decline in the National Murder Rate

January 2, 1999

    The Justice Department study on homicide trends released today shows 
that America's murder rate has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years, 
with much of the decline coming from the drop in youth gun homicides. 
Our cities are now the safest they have been in a generation. With the 
help of the '94 crime act, cities have replaced gang and gun violence 
with more police and tougher gun enforcement, and their efforts are 
paying off in dramatic decreases in homicides. A variety of studies show 
that crime, and especially homicide, should continue to decline into the 
new year, and that is good news for Americans in 1999. But we have more 
to do, and we must stick to our plan. We must finish the job of putting 
100,000 more police on our streets, putting tougher laws on our books, 
and providing better opportunities for our young people.
