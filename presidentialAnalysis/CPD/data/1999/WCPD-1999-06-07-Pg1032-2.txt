Memorandum for the Secretary of State

Subject: Determination Under Subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of

    Pursuant to the authority vested in me under the Trade Act of 1974, 
as amended, Public Law 93-618, 88 Stat. 1978 (the ``Act''), I determine, 
pursuant to subsection 402(d)(1) of the Act, 19 U.S.C. 2432(d)(1), that 
the further extension of the wavier authority granted by section 402 of 
the Act will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the

the People's Republic of China will substantially promote the objectives 
of section 402 of the Act.
    You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the 
Federal Register.
