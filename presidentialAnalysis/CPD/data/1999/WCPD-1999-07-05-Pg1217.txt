Remarks at a Majority 2000 Dinner in New York City

June 28, 1999

    Hello, everyone. I really came over here just to have a chance to 
shake hands and say hello, because you were all in the theater, so you 
heard me speak and I don't think you should have to endure two speeches.
    I would like to say again how much I appreciate the leadership role 
that you assumed in making this evening a great success. I hope you 
enjoyed it as much as I did. And again, I want to thank the cast and all 
the people who put the production on. I thought it was magnificent.
    But mostly, I came here to thank you for making this a success and 
for helping Mr. Gephardt and the other Members of our congressional 
leadership here very happy and giving them a chance to have a good 
November next year.
    Thank you, Congressman Engel, Congressman Kennedy, Congressman 
Rangel, Congresswoman Lowey. Thank you all very much. Congressman Payne, 
thank you.
    God bless you. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 8:30 p.m. at the Supper Club.
