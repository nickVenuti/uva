Notice--Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations

August 10, 1999

    On August 19, 1994, consistent with the authority provided me under 
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et 
seq.), I issued Executive Order 12924. In that order, I declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 
1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.). Because the Export 
Administration Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national 
emergency declared on August 19, 1994, must continue in effect beyond 
August 19, 1999. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 12924.
    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
August 10, 1999.

[Filed with the Office of the Federal Register, 8:45 a.m., August 12, 
1999]

Note: This notice was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
August 11, and it was published in the Federal Register on August 13.
