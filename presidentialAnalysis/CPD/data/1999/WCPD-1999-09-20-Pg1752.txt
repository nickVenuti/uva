Statement on House Action on Campaign Finance Reform Legislation

September 15, 1999

    I am heartened that the House of Representatives rejected the 
politics of business as usual by passing real, bipartisan campaign 
finance reform. Passage of the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform 
legislation is a victory for the American people. Now I urge the Senate 
Republican leadership to let a majority rule by allowing the Senate to 
take an up-or-down vote on this historic legislation. The time has come 
for Congress to redeem the public's faith in the health of our 
democracy.
