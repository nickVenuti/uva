Notice--Continuation of Libyan Emergency

December 29, 1999

    On January 7, 1986, by Executive Order 12543, former President 
Reagan declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government 
of Libya. On January 8, 1986, by Executive Order 12544, the President 
took additional measures to block Libyan assets in the United States. 
The President has transmitted a notice continuing this emergency to the 
Congress and the Federal Register every year since 1986.
    The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been 
resolved. Despite the United Nations Security Council's suspension of 
U.N. sanctions against Libya upon the Libyan government's hand over of 
the Pan Am 103 bombing suspects, there are still concerns about the 
Libyan government's support for terrorist activities and its 
noncompliance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 731 
(1992), 748 (1992), and 883 (1993).
    Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national 
emergency with respect to Libya. This notice shall be published in the 
Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
December 29, 1999.

[Filed with the Office of the Federal Register, 2:08 p.m., December 30, 
1999]

Note: This notice was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
January 3, 2000, and it was published in the Federal Register on January 
3.
