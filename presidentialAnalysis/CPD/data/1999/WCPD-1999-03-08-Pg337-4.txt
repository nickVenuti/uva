Message to the Senate Transmitting the Republic of Korea-United States 
Extradition Treaty With Documentation

March 2, 1999

To the Senate of the United States:

    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Republic of Korea, signed at Washington on June 9, 1998 (hereinafter the 
``Treaty'').
    In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. The Treaty 
will not require implementing legislation.

    The Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between 
the law enforcement communities of the United States and Korea. It will 
provide, for the first time, a framework and basic protections for 
extraditions between Korea and the United States, thereby making a 
significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts.
    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
March 2, 1999.
