crisis.
    These funds will be used to meet the urgent and unexpected needs of 
refugees, displaced persons, victims of conflict, and other persons at 
risk due to the Kosovo crisis. These funds may be used, as appropriate,

    You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees 
of the Congress of this determination and the use of funds under this 
authority, and to arrange for the publication of this determination in 
the Federal Register.
