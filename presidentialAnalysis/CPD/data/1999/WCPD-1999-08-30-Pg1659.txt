Statement on Proposed Patients' Bill of Rights Legislation

August 23, 1999

    Protecting the health of America's families is not and should never 
be a partisan issue. Demonstrating this fact, the American Medical 
Association, the largest organization of physicians in the Nation, has 
just endorsed the bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights sponsored by 
Congressman Norwood and Congressman Dingell.
    The AMA's action sends a strong message to Congress that it is time 
to put politics aside and pass a Patients' Bill of Rights that provides 
meaningful protections for all Americans in all health plans and holds 
plans accountable when their actions cause harm to patients. With over 
20 House Republicans cosponsoring the Norwood-Dingell bill, it is clear 
that a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives is ready to 
vote for a strong and enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.
    The bipartisan Norwood-Dingell coalition has placed the needs of 
patients over the desires of special interests. It is long past time for 
the entire Congress to follow suit. I reiterate my call to Speaker 
Hastert to schedule a vote on this important legislation immediately 
upon return from the congressional recess in September.

White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
