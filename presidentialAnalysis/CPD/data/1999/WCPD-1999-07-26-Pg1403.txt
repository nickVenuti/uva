Remarks on Returning From Camp David, Maryland

July 18, 1999

Disappearance of John F. Kennedy, Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and 
Lauren Bessette

    As the search continues, I want to express our family's support, and 
offer our prayers and those of all Americans for John Kennedy, Jr.; his 
wife, Carolyn; her sister Lauren; and to their fine families.
    I also want to thank the Coast Guard and all those who have worked 
so hard in this endeavor.
    For more than 40 years now, the Kennedy family has inspired 
Americans to public service, strengthened our faith in the future, and 
moved our Nation forward. Through it all they have suffered much, and 
given more.
    In recent years, in particular, John
Kennedy, Jr., and Carolyn have captured our imagination and won our 
affection. I will always be grateful for their kindnesses to 
Hillary and Chelsea and me.
    At this difficult moment, we hope the families of these three fine 
young people will feel the strength of God, the love of their friends, 
and the prayers of their fellow citizens.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 4:13 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to the search and rescue efforts off 
the coast of Martha's Vineyard, MA, to locate the aircraft that carried 
Mr. Kennedy, his wife, and her sister, who were reported missing on July 
17.
