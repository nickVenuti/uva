Statement on the Retirement of Michael Jordan

January 13, 1999

    Today's retirement announcement by Michael Jordan marks a sad day 
for all those who love basketball and for sports fans around the world. 
In his many years on the court, Michael brought superhuman skill and 
unmatched athleticism, competitive fire, dedication, and teamwork to the 
all-American sport he loves. Like those other American pioneers, the 
Wright Brothers, Michael Jordan proved that humans can indeed fly.
    Beyond his uncanny ability to defy gravity or hit the crucial shot 
when everything depended on it, Michael showed generations of young 
sports fans how to be a good person while being a great champion. 
Although we will miss seeing him play, we know at least that his career 
ended exactly as it should have, with one last game-winning basket to 
bring the Chicago Bulls their sixth championship.
    As a daughter of Chicago, Hillary is especially sorry to see him go. 
We wish Michael, Juanita, and their family all the best in the future.

Note: This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
as a statement by the President and the First Lady.
