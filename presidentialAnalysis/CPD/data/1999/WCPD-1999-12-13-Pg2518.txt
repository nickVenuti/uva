Statement on the World Trade Organization Seattle Round

December 4, 1999

    We made progress at the Seattle WTO trade meetings although 
significant differences remain. I remain optimistic that we can use the 
coming months to narrow our differences and launch a successful new 
round of global trade talks. A successful round will include bringing 
down barriers in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, keeping E-
commerce tariff-free and ensuring that trade will lift living conditions 
for working people everywhere while protecting the environment. And, as 
I said in Seattle, a successful WTO must be more open and accessible to 
all citizens around the world.
    I am determined to move forward on the path of free trade and 
economic growth while ensuring a human face is put on the global 
economy.
