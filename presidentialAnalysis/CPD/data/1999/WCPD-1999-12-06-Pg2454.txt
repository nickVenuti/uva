Statement on Ulster Unionist Council Action in the Northern Ireland 
Peace Process

November 27, 1999

    I welcome this historic step toward lasting peace in Northern 
Ireland and congratulate David Trimble on his leadership in bringing 
about a successful vote in the Ulster Unionist Council. The Ulster 
Unionist decision today, which follows critical decisions by all the 
pro-Agreement parties over the past several weeks, is an important move 
forward to full implementation of the Good Friday accord in all its 
aspects. Beginning next week, government in Northern Ireland is being 
put back directly in the hands of all the people. I welcome this 
progress and urge all parties to continue working together on building 
the foundations for lasting peace. I pledge the support of the United 
States to all those who are helping to make possible a brighter future 
for Northern Ireland.
