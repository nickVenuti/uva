Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting Documentation on the 
Extension of Normal Trade Relations Status With Vietnam

June 3, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974 (the ``Act''), as amended, with respect to the 
continuation of a waiver of the application of subsections (a) and (b) 
of section 402 of the Act to Vietnam. This document constitutes my 
recommendation to continue in effect this waiver for a further 12-month 
period and includes my determination that continuation of the waiver 
currently in effect for Vietnam will substantially promote the 
objectives of section 402 of the Act, and my reasons for such 
determination.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
