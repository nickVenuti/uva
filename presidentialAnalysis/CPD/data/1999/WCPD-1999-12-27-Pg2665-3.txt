Christmas Greeting to the Nation

December 24, 1999

    The President. On this holiest of holidays, Hillary and I would like 
to wish all of you a very merry Christmas. This is a season of joy, a 
time for family and friends to rejoice in one another's company and in 
the magic of Christmas. This is also the season of peace.
    On behalf of all Americans, I'd like to send a special greeting to 
the brave men and women in uniform who are serving our country in lands 
far from home. Thank you for the greatest gift of the season, for 
protecting our Nation and safeguarding the blessings we all hold dear.
    The First Lady. At the dawn of this new millennium, let us reflect 
on our hopes, our dreams, and the gifts we can give to the future. So 
let all of us cherish the gift of every child among us and pledge to 
build a world where all children, no matter where they are born, can 
make their dreams come true.
    The President. From our family to yours, Merry Christmas, Happy New 
Year, and may God bless you all.

Note: The greeting was videotaped at approximately 2:30 p.m. in Room 459 
in the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building for later 
broadcast and was made available by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
December 23 but was embargoed for release until 12:01 a.m., December 24. 
A tape was not available for verification of the content of this 
greeting.
