Statement on the Death of Meg Greenfield

May 13, 1999

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Meg 
Greenfield. In her work for the Washington Post and Newsweek, Meg 
perfected the art of the newspaper column. Her essays were invariably 
tightly reasoned, forcefully stated, and deeply felt. She called on 
those of us who work in Government to pursue farsighted public policy 
and bipartisan solutions. Her voice of eloquence and reason will be 
sorely missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family in their 
time of mourning.
