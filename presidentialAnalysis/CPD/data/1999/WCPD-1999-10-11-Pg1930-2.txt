Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Report on 
Implementation of the Partnership For Peace

October 5, 1999

Dear Mr. Chairman:

    In accordance with section 514(a) of Public Law 103-236, I am 
submitting to you this report on implementation of the Partnership for 
Peace (PFP).
    As noted in last year's report to the Congress, PFP has been a 
critical tool in helping

all the Partners, regardless of their desire to join NATO, to build 
stronger ties with the Alliance and develop closer cooperative 
relationships with all their neighbors. As you will see from the 
attached report, NATO Allies and Partners have managed to create a 
fundamentally different Partnership through the Euro-Atlantic 
Partnership Council (EAPC) and PFP enhancements.
    The EAPC and PFP have provided a means for incorporating Partners 
into NATO's operation in Bosnia, assisting Albania in rebuilding its 
armed forces, and helping Partners in Southeastern Europe cope with the 
Kosovo crisis. Enhancements to PFP provide a solid foundation for closer 
NATO-Partner collaboration and a mechanism for Partners to develop the 
interoperability with NATO that will be necessary for future NATO-led 
Allied/Partner missions.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations, and Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman, House 
Committee on International Relations.
