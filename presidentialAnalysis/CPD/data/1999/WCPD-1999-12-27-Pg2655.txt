Radio Remarks for the 1999 Walt Disney World Holiday Celebration

    Hello, this is President Bill Clinton. I'm sure everyone around the 
world appreciates how special this year's holiday celebration is. We're 
about to enter a new millennium, an era of tremendous promise and 
opportunity. There is no better time than now to reflect on our hopes 
and dreams and the gifts we want to leave for the future. We can all do 
something to make the world a better place.
    Hillary, Chelsea, and I want to wish everyone listening the happiest 
of holidays. And as we celebrate the future, it is our hope that your 
dreams for the new millennium will come true.
