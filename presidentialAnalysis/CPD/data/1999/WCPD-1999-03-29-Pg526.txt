Radio Remarks on Emergency Farm Measures

March 26, 1999

    Today I have directed Secretary Glickman to take immediate measures 
to provide urgently needed resources to our Nation's farmers as they 
enter the spring planting season. I asked Congress to pass emergency 
funding of $150 million to provide more than $1 billion in loans for 
farmers and ranchers. Unfortunately, Congress did not complete action 
before leaving for a 2-week recess, in spite of the fact that many of 
our Government's critical emergency farm loan programs are set to run 
out of funds in the next several weeks.
    Therefore, I am taking this immediate stop-gap measure so that our 
farmers, who face continuing low crop prices and difficulty in securing 
private loans, will be able to finance spring planting. This action will 
make more than $300 million in loans available to farmers and ranchers. 
I urge Congress when

it returns from its recess to move immediately on our emergency request 
for funds for farm loans.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 12:30 p.m. 
in the Oval Office at the White House for later broadcast. These remarks 
were also made available on the White House Press Radio Actuality Line.
