Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus

January 28, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period October 1 to November 30, 1998. The 
previous submission covered events during August and September 1998.
    Following United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's September 30 
announcement of an initiative to reduce tensions and promote progress 
towards a just and lasting settlement, the United Nations launched 
shuttle talks between both communities in October. During the reporting 
period, U.S. officials urged the leaders of both Cypriot communities to 
support fully the U.N. initiative. They also underscored my 
Administration's commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the Cyprus 
dispute based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
