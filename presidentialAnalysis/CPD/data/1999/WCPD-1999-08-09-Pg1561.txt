Statement on the Executive Order on Federalism

August 5, 1999

    As a former Governor, I know how important it is for the American 
people that the Federal Government and State and local governments work 
together as partners. The Executive order on federalism I signed will 
strengthen our partnership with State and local governments and ensure 
that executive branch agencies are able to do their work on behalf of 
the American people. I want to thank the representatives of State and 
local governments who worked with my administration in developing an 
Executive order that enables us to better serve all of the American 
people.
