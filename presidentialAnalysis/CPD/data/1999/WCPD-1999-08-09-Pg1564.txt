Statement on Senate Confirmation of Richard C. Holbrooke as U.S. 
Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations

August 5, 1999

    I am deeply gratified that the Senate has approved Ambassador 
Richard C. Holbrooke's nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador and 
Permanent Representative to the United Nations. I am grateful to 
Ambassador Holbrooke for his commitment to public service and especially 
for his willingness to persevere through the confirmation process.
    Vice President Gore, Secretary Albright, and I welcome him back to 
our foreign policy team. With the U.N. facing signficant challenges in 
Kosovo, Iraq, Africa, and elsewhere, Ambassador Holbrooke is the right 
person to lead our efforts at the U.N. He will play a key role in 
working with the Congress to meet our obligations and to secure needed 
reforms at the United Nations.
    Since he joined the Foreign Service 37 years ago, Ambassador 
Holbrooke has served our Nation with distinction in Asia, Africa, and 
Europe. I am confident that he will represent the United States with 
dedication.
