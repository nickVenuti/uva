Message to the Congress on Ordering the Selected and Individual Ready 
Reserves to Active Duty

April 27, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:

    I have today, pursuant to section 12304 of title 10, United States 
Code, authorized the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of 
Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard, when it is not operating 
as a service within the Department of the Navy, under their respective 
jurisdictions, to order to active duty any units, and any individual 
members not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, of the 
Selected Reserve, or any member in the Individual Ready Reserve 
mobilizations category and designated essential under regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary concerned. These reserves will augment the 
active components in support of operations in and around the former 
Yugoslavia related to the conflict in Kosovo.
    A copy of the Executive order implementing this action is attached.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
April 27, 1999.
