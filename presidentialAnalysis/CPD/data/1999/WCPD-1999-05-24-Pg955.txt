Statement on the Shooting at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia

May 20, 1999

    Today's shooting at Heritage High School in Georgia was deeply 
troubling to us all. In the wake of these terrible incidents, all 
Americans must come together and do everything we can to protect 
children from violence. I applaud the Senate for today's historic vote 
to close the gun show loophole and keep guns out of the hands of 
criminals and children.
