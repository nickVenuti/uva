Statement on House Action on Gun Control Legislation

June 18, 1999

    This week, instead of listening to the American people and 
strengthening our gun laws, the House of Representatives listened to the 
gun lobby and did nothing at all. The House leadership gutted this bill 
in the dark of night to keep commonsense gun legislation from seeing the 
light of day.
    The American people will not stand for this. Our Nation is waiting 
for Washington to pass a real law that keeps guns away from children and 
out of the hands of criminals. I call on the Congress to stop playing 
politics and start living up to its responsibility to help save lives.
