Statement on House Action on the Proposed ``African Growth and 
Opportunity Act''

November 2, 1999

    Today's vote is an important milestone in our effort to build a new 
economic relationship with sub-Saharan Africa and deepen ties with our 
Caribbean and Central American neighbors. This legislation will help 
increase trade, enhance opportunity, and boost economic growth in 
America and nations in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America. I 
urge the Senate to pass this bill as soon as possible.
