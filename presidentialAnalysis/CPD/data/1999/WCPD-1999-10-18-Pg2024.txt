Statement on Floods and Mudslides in Mexico

October 13, 1999

    On behalf of the American people, I want to express our deepest 
condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives and homes 
in the devastating floods and mudslides in Mexico, which have taken 
hundreds of lives and left tens of thousands of people homeless. It was 
less than a month ago that Hurricane Floyd brought flooding to the 
States along our own East Coast, reminding us of the pain such tragedies 
can bring and of the importance of neighbor helping neighbor in times of 
crisis. In the days ahead, our thoughts and prayers will be with our 
good friends, the people of Mexico, as they work to rebuild from these 
terrible tragedies. As a people and a Government, we stand ready to help 
in any way we can.
