Statement on the Release of American Infantrymen Held Prisoner by 
Serbian Authorities

May 2, 1999

    I am pleased that our three American servicemen who have been held 
as prisoners by Serbian authorities have today been released and that 
they are now safely out of Serbia. I am grateful to Reverend Jackson and 
his delegation for helping to secure their freedom. All of America is 
anticipating their safe return.
    As we welcome our soldiers home, our thoughts also turn to the over 
one million Kosovars who are unable to go home because of the policies 
of the regime in Belgrade. Today we reaffirm our resolve to persevere 
until they, too, can return with security and self-government.

Note: In this statement, the President referred to civil rights leader 
Jesse Jackson, whose personal appeal won the release of Staff Sgt. 
Andrew A. Ramirez, USA, Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, USA, and 
Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, USA.
