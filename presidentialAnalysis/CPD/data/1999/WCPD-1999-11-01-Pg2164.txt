Statement on the Attack at the Armenian Parliament

October 27, 1999

    I am shocked and saddened by today's armed attacks in the Armenian 
Parliament. I condemn this senseless act against individuals actively 
engaged in building democracy in their country. The victims and their 
families are in our thoughts and prayers.
    The United States has built strong ties with Armenia, focused on 
helping the Armenian people build a prosperous, secure, and democratic 
future. At this time of tragedy, we renew our support for the Armenian 
people and their leaders as they continue to build on the principles 
that today's victims have so courageously embodied.
