Statement on the Texas A&M University Bonfire Tower Tragedy

November 19, 1999

    Today I spoke with Dr. Ray Bowen, president of Texas A&M University, 
to extend my deepest sympathies on the tragedy that occurred at the 
campus. This is a heartbreaking loss. America stands with the College 
Station community as it joins together during this difficult time. 
Hillary and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the families and friends 
of those who were injured or killed in this devastating incident.
