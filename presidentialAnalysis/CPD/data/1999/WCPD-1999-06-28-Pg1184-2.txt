Statement on Accepting the Invitation To Serve as Honorary Chairman of 
the Presidents Cup

June 25, 1999

    I am pleased to accept the invitation to serve as honorary chairman 
of the Presidents Cup, one of the premier international events in golf. 
I thank Commissioner Tim Finchem and the PGA Tour as well as the 
participating international golf tours for this invitation. It is an 
honor to succeed Presidents George Bush and Gerald Ford, as well as 
Australian Prime Minister John Howard, as honorary chairman of this 
event.
    I know that, more and more, people around the world share America's 
enthusiasm for golf. The Presidents Cup helps bring our countries 
together in spirited and good-natured competition. In 1996 I was glad to 
attend the Presidents Cup at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club, and I am 
looking forward to another display of skill and sportsmanship by the 
United States and international teams in October 2000.
