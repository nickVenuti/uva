Statement on the Death of Jonas Salk

June 23, 1995

    Hillary and I want to extend our deepest sympathies to the family 
and friends of Dr. Jonas Salk, a man whose indefatigable pursuit of 
solutions made this world a better place to live. The victory of this 
medical pioneer over a dreaded disease continues to touch many, from the 
students who study his work to the countless individuals whose lives 
have been saved by his efforts. His polio vaccine opened the door to a 
society in which good health was taken for granted. And, over the last 
decade, his efforts to find a cure for AIDS gave us all hope. He was a 
true leader, and we will miss him greatly.
