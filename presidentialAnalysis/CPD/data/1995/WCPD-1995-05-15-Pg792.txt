Statement on Senate Confirmation of John Deutch as Director of Central 
Intelligence

May 9, 1995

    I am very pleased with the Senate's overwhelming 98-0 vote to 
confirm John Deutch as Director of Central Intelligence. The Senate's 
action is further affirmation of the outstanding leadership and 
management skills John Deutch will bring to the intelligence community 
and the CIA. I have the greatest confidence that he will bring a renewed 
sense of purpose, direction, and spirit to the CIA and the intelligence 
community.
