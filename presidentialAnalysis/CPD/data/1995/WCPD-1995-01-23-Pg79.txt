Message to the Congress Transmitting the Estonia-United States Fishery 
Agreement

January 19, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et. seq.), I transmit herewith the Agreement 
between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Republic of Estonia Extending the Agreement of June 1, 
1992, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coast of the United States. The 
Agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at Tallinn on 
March 11 and May 12, 1994, extends the 1992 Agreement to June 30, 1996.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Republic of Estonia, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
January 19, 1995.
