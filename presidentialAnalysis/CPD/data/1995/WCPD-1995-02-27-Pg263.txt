Message on the Observance of Presidents' Day, 1995

February 16, 1995

    Greetings to Americans across the country celebrating Presidents' 
Day, 1995. As citizens gather to reflect upon our nation's rich history, 
I am proud to salute our former Presidents for the legacy of leadership 
they have built in this nation.
    From the bold example of George Washington to the timeless courage 
of Abraham Lincoln--the Presidents whose birthdays we commemorate 
today--each President, in his own way, has sought to use the power of 
the American government to make our country better, stronger, and truer 
to the ideals of its charter. Fueled by the mission of our nation's 
citizens, Presidents of each generation have aspired to serve the common 
good, recognizing that whether we Americans choose to rise or fall, move 
forward or backward, we will all do so together. On this special 
occasion, and in honor of that great tradition, I ask each of you to 
join in rededicating yourselves to maintaining the freedoms we hold most 
dear, for ourselves and for the generations to come.
    Best wishes for a wonderful holiday celebration.
                                            William J. Clinton
