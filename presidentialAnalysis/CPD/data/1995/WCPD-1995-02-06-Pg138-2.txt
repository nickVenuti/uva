Remarks at the National Governors' Association Gala

January 29, 1995

    Thank you. Well, we want to thank John and Jonathan and Mary Chapin 
Carpenter. And at least from my part, I know how hard it is to do 
anything when you're hoarse. [Laughter]

    It doesn't get any better than this. You were wonderful. We thank 
you. It's been wonderful for Hillary and for me to have all of you here. 
There will be music out in the foyer and a little dancing if you have a 
little of that spirit.
    I will say this: For all of us who come from small towns all across 
America, I wish I had a nickel for every time I drove through that town 
you sang about tonight. [Laughter]
    Thank you all. God bless you, and good night.

Note: The President spoke at 10:48 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to singer Mary Chapin Carpenter and 
her accompanists, John Jennings and Jonathan Carroll.
