Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Pakistan

this cowardly act. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for the 
excellent cooperation it has already provided.
    Our hearts go out to the families of Gary Durell, a communicator, 
and Jacqueline van Landingham, a consulate secretary, who were killed. 
We pray for the speedy recovery of Mark McCloy, a consulate spouse, who 
was wounded.
    Attacks such as these should make the international community 
rededicate itself to efforts to stamp out terrorism everywhere.
