Message to the Congress on Trade With the West Bank and the Gaza Strip

March 17, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:

    I am writing to inform you of my intent to designate the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip as a beneficiary of the Generalized System of Preferences 
(GSP). The GSP program, which offers duty-free access to the U.S. 
market, was originally authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.

[[Page 472]]

    I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 
and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, I have 
determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
March 17, 1995.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on
