    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of the 
International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288), and having 
found that the Israel-United States Binational Industrial Research and 
Development Foundation is a public international organization in which 
the United States participates within the meaning of the International 
Organizations Immunities Act, I hereby designate the Israel-United 
States Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation as a 
public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, 
exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations 
Immunities Act. This designation is not intended to abridge in any 
respect the privileges, exemptions, or immunities that such organization 
may have acquired or may acquire by international agreements or by 
congressional action.
