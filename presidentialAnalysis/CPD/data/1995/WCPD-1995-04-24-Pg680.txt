Statement Announcing the Award of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 
Gaylord Nelson

April 21, 1995

    I am pleased to announce my intention to award the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom to former Senator Gaylord Nelson, who as State 
Legislator, Governor, and Senator championed the protection of our 
natural resources. As we commemorate the 25th anniversary of Earth Day, 
his creation, it is fitting that we honor this great American's lifetime 
of public service.
    In establishing Earth Day, Gaylord Nelson helped us to recognize 
that our fragile environment was increasingly at peril and that each of 
us could make a difference. His work has inspired all Americans to take 
responsibility for the planet's well-being and for our children's 
future.
    I look forward to presenting the Medal to Senator Nelson.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
April 21, 1995.
