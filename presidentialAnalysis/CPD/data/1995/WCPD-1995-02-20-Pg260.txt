Statement on Disaster Assistance for Georgia, Florida, and Alabama

February 17, 1995

    We will continue to stand by the people of Georgia, Florida, and 
Alabama as they do the hard work of recovering from last summer's 
storms, rebuilding their homes, repairing their roads, and restarting 
their businesses.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
an additional $145 million in emergency funding for the States to assist 
in their continuing recovery from the effects of Tropical Storm Alberto.
