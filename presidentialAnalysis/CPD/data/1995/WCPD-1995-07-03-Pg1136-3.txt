Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus

June 26, 1995

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through March 31, 
1995. The current report covers April 1, 1995 through May 31, 1995.
    The central event of this period was the May 21-23 exploratory talks 
between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. These talks were held in 
London and facilitated by Presidential Emissary Beattie and Special 
Cyprus Coordinator Williams. The talks laid the groundwork for a second 
visit to the island by Mr. Beattie to explore possible areas of 
agreement between Greek-Cypriot leader Clerides and Turkish-Cypriot 
leader Denktash.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
