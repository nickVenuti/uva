Statement on Compensation for Persian Gulf Veterans

February 22, 1995

    Today, the country takes a long-overdue step to recognize the 
sacrifices of these Persian Gulf veterans. We are taking an 
unprecedented approach to assisting these veterans by providing 
compensation for conditions that have defied conventional diagnoses. We 
encourage any Persian Gulf veteran who is sick to file a claim, and we 
will automatically reopen previously denied claims as a result of this 
new law.
    I felt that we could not wait on science. For some Persian Gulf 
veterans like Michael Sills, medical science does not have answers 
today, but we must not and will not give up.
    Michael Sills and veterans like him who served their country 
honorably have earned our gratitude. And when they are sick, we must do 
what is right.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
that the President met with Michael I. Sills, one of the first 
recipients of a compensation check awarded to Persian Gulf veterans with 
chronic disabilities resulting from undiagnosed illnesses.
