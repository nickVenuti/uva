Statement on Budget Rescission Legislation

July 10, 1995

    The agreement on the rescissions bill that my administration has 
reached with Democrats and Republicans in the Congress is a good one, 
and it ought to be passed now.
    I was disappointed when the Senate failed to complete the job before 
its recent recess. Now that they have returned, I call on Senators to 
resolve their differences and pass the bill as early as possible.
    The bill achieves needed deficit reduction while protecting key 
investments in children and education and in national service, job 
training, and the environment. I believe it can be a model for future 
deficit reduction efforts.
    Moreover, the rescissions legislation includes funds I requested 
that are urgently needed for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 
disaster relief activities, for the Federal response to the Oklahoma 
City bombing, for expanding antiterrorism efforts, and for providing 
debt relief to Jordan, which is critical to the Middle East peace 
process.
    I urge the Senate to act quickly on this vital legislation.
