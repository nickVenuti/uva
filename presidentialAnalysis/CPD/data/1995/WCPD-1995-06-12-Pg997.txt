Message on the Rescue of Captain Scott O'Grady

June 8, 1995

    All Americans rejoice with me at the successful rescue of Captain 
Scott O'Grady tonight and join his parents in their relief after days of 
uncertainty and anguish. Captain O'Grady's bravery and skill are an 
inspiration. So are the bravery and skill of those who took part in the 
operation to rescue him. They are all American heroes. Please give them 
each--and all the men and women who supported them--our heartfelt thanks 
for a job done so very well. This is a moment that will long be 
remembered by a nation that is very proud of all her sons and daughters 
serving under your command.
