Statement on New Investment Funds for Central and Eastern Europe

January 13, 1995

    In Prague last January, I promised we would create investment funds 
for Central and Eastern Europe. This January we have four of them. They 
can mean billions of dollars in capital investment to help fuel economic 
development in the region while creating jobs for Americans at home.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the new investment funds.
