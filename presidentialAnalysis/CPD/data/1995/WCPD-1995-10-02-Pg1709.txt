Letter to Congressional Leaders on Radio Spectrum Assignments

September 25, 1995

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    Title VI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 requires 
that the Secretary of Commerce identify 200 megahertz (MHz) of the radio 
spectrum assigned to Federal Government use for reallocation to the 
Federal Communications Commission for nonfederal use.
    Under delegated authority, the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA) is responsible for managing the 
Federal Government's use of the radio spectrum. On March 22, 1995, 
Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown submitted to you NTIA's Spectrum 
Reallocation Final Report that identified for reallocation in August 
1995, the 2300-2310 and 2400-2402 MHz bands for exclusive nonfederal use 
and the 2417-2450 MHz band for mixed Federal and nonfederal use.
    I am pleased to inform you that the Federal Government frequency 
assignments in the spectrum identified for reallocation for exclusive 
nonfederal use have been withdrawn by NTIA in compliance with section 
114 of the Act. In addition, modifications were made to the National 
Table of Frequency Allocations for Government stations to reflect the 
reallocation of the spectrum.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate, and Reed 
E. Hundt, Chair, Federal Communications Commission.
