Statement on Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown

May 17, 1995

    Secretary Brown's success as Secretary of Commerce is unparalleled. 
Through his service, the Department has expanded opportunities for 
American businesses in this country and abroad. I know him to be a 
dedicated public servant. The Attorney General has determined that the 
facts warrant the appointment of an independent counsel. As I have noted 
in the past, the legal standard for such an appointment is low. I am 
confident at the conclusion of the process, the independent counsel will 
find no wrongdoing by Secretary Brown. In the interim, I value his 
continued service on behalf of this country.
