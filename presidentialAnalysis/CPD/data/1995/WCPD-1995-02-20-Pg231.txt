Statement on Argentina's Accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty

February 10, 1995

    I warmly welcome Argentina's accession to the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) this morning. In joining the NPT, Argentina 
has taken an historic step to reinforce its own security and to unite 
with 170 other NPT parties in the global effort to stem the spread of 
nuclear weapons. I salute President Menem and his government for their 
foresight and courage in making Argentina a champion for 
nonproliferation in Latin America and around the world. In the State of 
the Union Address, I pledged that the United States would lead the 
charge for indefinite extension of the NPT when the treaty's future is 
considered this April. Argentina's NPT adherence will help us reach that 
goal.
