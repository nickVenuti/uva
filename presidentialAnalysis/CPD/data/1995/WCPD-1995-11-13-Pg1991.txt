Notice--Continuation of Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction

November 8, 1995

    On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order No. 12938, I declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical 
weapons (``weapons of mass destruction'') and the means of delivering 
such weapons. Because the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
and the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
November 14, 1994, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 1995. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order No. 12938.
    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
November 8, 1995.
