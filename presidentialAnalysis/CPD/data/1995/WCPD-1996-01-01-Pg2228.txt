Statement on the Airline Tragedy Near Buga, Colombia

December 22, 1995

    Hillary and I offer our profound condolences to the many families 
whose loved ones perished in the crash December 20 of American Airlines 
flight 965 near Buga, Colombia. Coming on the eve of the holiday season, 
this tragic event takes on even greater poignancy. I have dispatched an 
interagency team to the site which, working alongside Colombian 
authorities, will pursue the goals of searching for survivors, 
identifying victims, and determining the cause of the crash.
    Our hopes and prayers, along with those of all Americans, are with 
those whose lives have been so affected by this tragedy.
