Statement on the National Economy

July 7, 1995

    Today's employment report shows that since the start of our 
administration, the economy has created 7 million jobs, with over 92 
percent of them created in the private sector. When I ran for President, 
I stated that this country must have a strategy to strengthen and 
restore the American dream and that a core element of this strategy must 
be to create more and better jobs for hardworking Americans.
    Seven million jobs in 30 months is very good news, but still not 
good enough: millions of families are still working harder than ever 
just to stay in place. In order to increase incomes for hardworking 
Americans, we must remain committed to a broadbased economic strategy to 
reward work, balance the budget, open markets for American goods, invest 
in education and training, target tax cuts to helping families invest in 
their futures, and take serious steps to health reform while protecting 
Medicare.
