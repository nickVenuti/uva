Statement on the AFL-CIO Election

October 25, 1995

    There were plenty of winners in today's AFL-CIO election. The 
working men and women of the labor movement benefit the most. If every 
American got to choose in every election between candidates such as 
these, this country would be a better place.
    I offer my hearty congratulations to John Sweeney, who has led one 
of the most progressive, growing, and innovative unions in America. He 
has been a force for inclusion and activism and has already left a deep 
and positive imprint on the labor movement.
    The outgoing president, Tom Donahue, has been a source of strength 
and leadership in the labor movement for decades. Working men and women 
are fortunate for his many years of service, his integrity, and his 
dedication.
    The theme of AFL-CIO convention was ``Stand Up for America's Working 
Families.'' My administration stands with John and the other newly 
elected officers as we work together in the months and years ahead on 
issues important to America's working families.
