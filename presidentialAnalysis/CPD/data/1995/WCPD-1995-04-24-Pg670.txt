buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on 
all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia 
and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions 
through Monday, April 24, 1995. I also direct that the flag shall be 
flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States 
embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, 
including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
    In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day 
of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
nineteenth.
                                            William J. Clinton
