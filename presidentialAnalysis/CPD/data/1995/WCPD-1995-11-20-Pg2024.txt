Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

November 13, 1995

    This morning's attack in Riyadh against an American facility is an 
outrage. Our condolences and prayers go out to the victims and their 
families. We appreciate the speed and professionalism with which Saudi 
authorities have responded to this emergency and will work closely with 
them in identifying those responsible for this cowardly act and bringing 
them to justice.
