Statement on the Nomination of Kweisi Mfume as Chairman of the NAACP

December 10, 1995

    I was delighted to hear about the nomination of Representative 
Kweisi Mfume to the leadership of the NAACP. In his distinguished career 
as the Representative of Baltimore's 7th District, Congressman Mfume has 
been an outspoken advocate for working Americans, an articulate voice on 
race relations and a tireless fighter against crime. His was a voice in 
the Congress that sought not to be divisive but to find common ground

on a wide spectrum of issues. I am disappointed that I will lose his 
support in the Congress, but I know that he will continue to provide me 
with wise counsel in his new role. He is a superb choice to lead the 
NAACP at this juncture, which for so many years has been an 
extraordinary champion of civil rights. I wish him all the best.
