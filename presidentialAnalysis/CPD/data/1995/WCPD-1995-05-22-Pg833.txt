Statement Honoring Police Officers at the National Law Enforcement 
Officers' Memorial

May 13, 1995

    You are gathered here tonight to honor the memory of 298 of your 
fellow law enforcement officers who laid down their lives to make our 
society more lawful and our lives more secure. In the finest tradition 
of America's law enforcement, every day these officers took to the 
streets and put the safety and well-being of other Americans above their 
own. By giving their lives to uphold the rule of law, these officers 
made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our freedom. They are American 
heroes, and I thank them and their families on behalf of a grateful 
nation.
    Tonight then, as you add the names of these brave men and women to 
the many thousands of fallen officers whose names already adorn the 
walls of this great memorial, let us honor the memory of all of these 
officers by rededicating ourselves to restoring the line between right 
and wrong and purging our society of the dark forces that threaten our 
common peace, our freedom and our way of life.

Note: Attorney General Janet Reno read the statement to participants 
assembled at the memorial for the seventh annual candlelight vigil.
