Statement on Reforms to Environmental Programs To Assist Homeowners

July 12, 1995

    I am pleased to announce significant reforms to the Endangered 
Species Act and Clean Water Act wetlands programs to benefit homeowners. 
Under these reforms, the vast majority of all American homeowners will 
never have to worry about endangered species or wetlands requirements.
    Specifically, for Endangered Species Act programs, the Department of 
the Interior will essentially eliminate restrictions on single family 
homeowners with five or fewer acres of land. Similarly, for wetlands 
programs, the Army Corps of Engineers will

issue a new nationwide permit to allow homeowners to construct or expand 
their residences without an individual permit. This will apply even if 
these activities involve filling as much as a half-acre of nontidal 
wetland.
    Finally, I have instructed the heads of each of the relevant 
departments and agencies to examine all of their programs to determine 
if there are other actions that they can take to benefit homeowners.
    Home ownership and the opportunity for homeowners to use their 
property without unnecessary restrictions are an essential part of the 
American dream. We can provide homeowners greater freedom and still 
protect the environment. This is common sense, reasonable reform--not a 
reckless, destructive rollback of health and environmental safeguards, 
as others are proposing.
