Statement on the Welfare Reform and Budget Negotiations

December 21, 1995

    I am disappointed that Republicans are trying to use the words 
``welfare reform'' as cover to advance a budget plan that is at odds 
with America's values. Americans know that welfare reform is not about 
playing budget politics; it is about moving people from welfare to work.
    I am determined to work with Congress to achieve real, bipartisan 
welfare reform. But if Congress sends me this conference report, I will 
veto it and insist that they try again. This welfare bill includes deep 
cuts that are tough on children and at odds with my central goal of 
moving people from welfare to work. The Republican budget cuts in 
Medicaid and the earned-income tax credit would undermine real reform 
and penalize people who choose work over welfare.
    At a time when we are trying to engage in serious negotiations 
toward a balanced budget that is consistent with our priorities--one of 
which is to ``reform welfare,'' as last month's agreement between 
Republicans and Democrats made clear--this is a sign of bad faith by the 
Republican leadership and an affront to those in both parties who 
genuinely want to enact real reform. My administration remains ready at 
any moment to sit down in good faith with Democrats and Republicans in 
Congress to work out a real welfare reform plan.
