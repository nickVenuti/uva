Statement on Senator Sam Nunn's Decision Not To Seek Reelection

October 9, 1995

    For the last 23 years, Senator Nunn has served our country with 
tireless devotion and steady leadership. He has earned the respect and 
appreciation of all Americans for his leadership in national security, 
defense, and foreign policy. He has urged us to deal with the long term 
challenges of our economy and to move beyond established political 
rhetoric to new policies that reward responsibility and work and to 
strengthen families and communities.
    I am grateful for his wise counsel and personal friendship and look 
forward to his continued leadership in setting the new Democratic agenda 
and America's agenda in 1996 and beyond. I wish him and his fine family 
well.
