Statement on Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros

March 14, 1995

    Henry Cisneros' service as Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development has been outstanding, and I know him to be a man of 
integrity and character. The Attorney General has determined that the 
facts warrant the appointment of an independent counsel to inquire into 
a question she believes is a ``close and difficult factual and legal 
issue.''
    Secretary Cisneros is a good man and an effective public servant. He 
says he regrets any mistakes he has made. So do I. But that does not 
outweigh the excellent work he has been doing and will do as Secretary 
of Housing and Urban Development. I look forward to his continued 
valuable service.
