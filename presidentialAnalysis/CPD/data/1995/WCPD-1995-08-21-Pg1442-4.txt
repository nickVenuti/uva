Notice on Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations

August 15, 1995

    On August 19, 1994, consistent with the authority provided me under 
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et 
seq.), I issued Executive Order No. 12924. In that order, I declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 
1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2401 et seq.). Because

the Export Administration Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the 
national emergency declared on August 19, 1994, must continue in effect 
beyond August 19, 1995. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12924.
    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
