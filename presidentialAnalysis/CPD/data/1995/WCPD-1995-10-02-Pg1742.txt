Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With King Hussein of Jordan

September 29, 1995

1996 Election

    Q. Mr. President, I don't know if you've heard that Governor Pete 
Wilson is going to drop out of the Presidential race this afternoon.
    The President. No. Are you sure? [Laughter] Well, I--that's a very 
personal decision. It's a difficult road, and I respect the judgment 
that he would make, or anybody would make under these circumstances, 
since I've been through it. I hope we will continue to be able to work 
together on some of our common problems. I said in Los Angeles when I 
was there a couple of days ago that the Governor's office worked very 
closely with us when we were trying to solve the problems of the medical 
center for Los Angeles County, and there's a lot of important work to do 
and he still has a very important job.
    Q. Does this help your prospects in California?
    The President. I don't know.

Note: The exchange began at 11:45 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, the President referred to Governor Pete Wilson of 
California. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
this exchange.
