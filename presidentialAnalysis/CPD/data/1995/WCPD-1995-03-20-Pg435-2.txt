Presidential Determination No. 95-17

Memorandum for the Secretary of State,

the Secretary of Defense

Subject: Drawdown of Commodities and Services from the Inventory and 
Resources of the Department of Defense to Support Activities of the 
Palestinian Police Force

    Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 552(c)(2) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)(2) (the 
``Act''), I hereby determine that:
(1)         as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of 
            assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts 
            in excess of funds otherwise available for such assistance 
            is important to the national interests of the United States; 
            and
(2)         such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision 
            of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
    I therefore direct the drawdown of commodities and services from the 
inventory and resources of the Department of Defense of an aggregate 
value not to exceed $5 million

Israel for use by the Palestinian police force.
    The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this 
determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the 
Federal Register.
                                            William J. Clinton
