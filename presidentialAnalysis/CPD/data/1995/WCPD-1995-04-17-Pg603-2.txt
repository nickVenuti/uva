Message on the Observance of Passover, 1995

April 10, 1995

    Warm greetings to all who are observing Passover.
    A celebration of both liberation and spring, Passover is a special 
opportunity to give thanks for the blessings of freedom and to remember 
the faith that sustains us in our bleakest hours. During this holiday, 
millions of Jews around the world draw inspiration from the example of 
the Israelites, who preserved their beliefs, their culture, and their 
dignity throughout the brutal winter of slavery. When the warm spring of 
freedom finally came, the Jewish people rebuilt their community and 
thrived, ultimately infusing every corner of the earth with a powerful 
commitment to faith and family.
    This year, let the Passover holiday remind us of the hope that can 
sustain us as a people. Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all 
for a meaningful Passover.
                                                  Bill Clinton
