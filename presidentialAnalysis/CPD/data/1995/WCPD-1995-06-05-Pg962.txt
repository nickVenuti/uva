Remarks on the F-16 Downed in Bosnia

June 2, 1995

    Good afternoon. I am very concerned about the loss of our F-16 over 
Bosnia and the fate of the American pilot, and we are following that 
situation closely.
    I have spoken today with President Chirac about the situation in 
Bosnia and about the meetings that Secretary Perry and General 
Shalikashvili will be attending. I've spoken with Secretary Perry and 
will meet with him and General Shali later today. We've also been in 
touch with the NATO commanders and with other governments.
    I want to reiterate and make absolutely clear that our policy on 
Bosnia remains firm. For reasons that I think are obvious, I will have 
no further comments on this situation today.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 2:20 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to President Jacques Chirac of the 
European Council.
