Statement on Senate Passage of Antiterrorism Legislation

June 7, 1995

    I am gratified that the Senate has passed a sweeping, bipartisan 
antiterrorism bill, as I called for in the wake of the bombing in 
Oklahoma City. This legislation will give law enforcement the tools it 
needs to do everything possible to prevent this kind of tragedy from 
happening again. It will also help us prosecute and punish terrorists 
more effectively. I urge the House to do its part and get a bill on my 
desk without delay.
