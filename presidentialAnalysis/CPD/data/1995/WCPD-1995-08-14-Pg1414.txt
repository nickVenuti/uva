Remarks Prior to a Roundtable Discussion on Teenage Smoking

August 10, 1995

    Well, good morning. Ladies and gentlemen, today I have brought 
together medical experts and children who have taken a pledge against 
smoking to talk about our common commitment to ending youth smoking.
    This issue is critical to our efforts to improve the health of our 
Nation. According to the Center for Disease Control, of the 2 million 
Americans who will die in 1995, over 400,000 of them will have 
conditions related to smoking.
    Later today I will announce my strategy for combating this problem 
based on one simple idea: We should do everything we possibly can to 
keep tobacco out of the hands of our young people in the United States.
    Now I'd like to call on Shana Bailey, who is a 12-year-old from 
Florida who's part of a successful program that teaches students how and 
why they should stay smoke-free.

Note: The President spoke at 10:18 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House.
