Proclamation 6767--To Amend the Generalized System of Preferences

February 3, 1995

By the President of the United States

of America

A Proclamation

    1. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (``Trade Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462), and having due regard 
for the eligibility criteria set forth therein, I have determined that 
it is appropriate to designate Armenia as a beneficiary developing 
country for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
    2. Pursuant to section 504(f) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(f)), 
I have determined that the per capita gross national product of The 
Bahamas has exceeded the applicable limit provided for in section 
504(f). Accordingly, pursuant to section 504(a) of the Trade Act (19 
U.S.C. 2464(a)), I have determined that it is appropriate to suspend the 
designation of The Bahamas as a beneficiary developing country for 
purposes of the GSP, and pursuant to section 504(f) of the Trade Act, I 
have determined that it is appropriate to terminate such designation.
    3. Pursuant to section 504(f) of the Trade Act, I have determined 
that the per capita gross national product of Israel has exceeded the 
applicable limit provided for in section 504(f). Accordingly, I have 
determined that it is appropriate to terminate the designation of Israel 
as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
    4. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other 
acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder.
    Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United 
States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not 
limited to sections 501, 504, and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim 
that:
    (1) General note 4(a) to the HTS, listing those countries whose 
products are eligible for benefits of the GSP, is modified by: (a) 
inserting ``Armenia'' in alphabetical order in the list of independent 
countries;
    (b) deleting ``Bahamas, The'' and ``Israel'' from the list of 
independent countries; and
    (c) deleting ``Bahamas, The'' from the list of Member Countries of 
the Caribbean Common Market, and amending the heading of that list to 
read ``Member Countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM), except 
The Bahamas''.
    (2) General note 4(d) to the HTS is modified as provided in Annex I 
to this proclamation.
    (3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
inconsistent with the provisions of this proclamation are hereby 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (4)(a) The modifications to the HTS made by paragraph (1)(a) of this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles that are: (i) 
imported on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse for consumption, on or after 15 days after the date of 
publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register.
    (b) The modifications to the HTS made by paragraphs (1)(b), (1)(c), 
and (2) shall be effective on July 1, 1995.
    In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
February, in the

year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
nineteenth.
                                            William J. Clinton
