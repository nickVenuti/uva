Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa

December 6, 1995

    Warm greetings to everyone who is observing the festival of Kwanzaa.
    Across America and around the globe, Kwanzaa is a vibrant 
celebration of African culture, encouraging us to gain a deeper 
appreciation of our families and the many blessings we enjoy. Kwanzaa's 
seven basic principles--unity, self-determination, collective work and 
responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith--

viduals in a unique celebration of a dynamic heritage. Renewing hope and 
restoring faith, Kwanzaa uplifts the human spirit, helping us to 
revitalize the bonds of family and the spirit of community.
    As millions of my fellow Americans commemorate Kwanzaa, I am 
delighted to send best wishes for a wonderful festival and a very happy 
new year.
                                            William J. Clinton
