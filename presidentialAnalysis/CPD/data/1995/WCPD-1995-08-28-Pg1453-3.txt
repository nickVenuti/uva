Statement on Disaster Assistance for New York State

August 24, 1995

    Tonight in Suffolk County, New York, firefighters and other 
emergency workers are heroically fighting several dangerous fires that 
have forced the evacuation of hundreds of people, including residents of 
two nursing homes among other facilities.
    In order to help the State and county governments sustain these 
efforts without worry of financial hardships, I have tonight authorized 
fire suppression grants which will allow the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to reimburse the State for most of the costs 
associated with the emergency operations.
    I have also directed the mobilization of the resources of the U.S. 
Forest Service to provide direct assistance in fighting the fires, 
including all necessary equipment and teams of particular expertise in 
fighting wild land fires. They are on their way. I have directed FEMA 
Director James Lee Witt and Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Jim Lyons 
to go to New York tonight to manage the Federal firefighting effort. 
Fires are frightening, and I know that the residents of these areas are 
going through difficult times. Our hearts and our prayers are with them, 
and we commend the efforts of all of those people on Long Island who are 
valiantly working to contain these blazes.

Note: The President also recorded this statement at 9 p.m. outside the 
press filing center in Jackson Hole, WY, for later broadcast in New York 
State.
