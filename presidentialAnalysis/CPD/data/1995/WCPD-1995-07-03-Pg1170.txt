Letter to the Speaker of the House on Emergency Salvage Timber Sale 
Legislation

June 29, 1995

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I am pleased to be able to address myself to the question of the 
Emergency Salvage Timber Sale Program in H.R. 1944. I want to make it 
clear that my Administration will carry out this program with its full 
resources and a strong commitment to achieving the goals of the program.
    I do appreciate the changes that the Congress has made to provide 
the Administration with the flexibility and authority to carry this 
program out in a manner that conforms to our existing environmental laws 
and standards. These changes are also important to

preserve our ability to implement the current forest plans and their 
standards and to protect other natural resources.
    The agencies responsible for this program will, under my direction, 
carry the program out to achieve the timber sales volume goals in the 
legislation to the fullest possible extent. The financial resources to 
do that are already available through the timber salvage sale fund.
    I would hope that by working together we could achieve a full array 
of forest health, timber salvage and environmental objectives 
appropriate for such a program.
    Sincerely,
                                                  Bill Clinton
