Statement on Senator Howell T. Heflin's Decision Not To Seek Reelection

March 29, 1995

    I was sorry to learn of Senator Heflin's decision not to run for 
reelection. His strong voice, his solid belief in right and wrong and 
his sense of humor have helped the Nation confront some of our toughest 
issues head on, while his efforts in areas of education and race 
relations have changed the course of the country. Although we will miss 
his leadership here in Washington, I wish him all the best in Tuscumbia.
