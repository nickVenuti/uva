Statement on the Commission on Immigration Reform

June 7, 1995

    Having met this morning with Chair Barbara Jordan, I want to 
congratulate the Commission on Immigration Reform for its recommendation 
on legal immigration. Consistent with my own views, the Commission's 
recommendations are pro-family, pro-work, pro-naturalization. As with 
the Commission's first report on illegal immigration, which we are now 
aggressively implementing, the Commission has again laid out a roadmap 
for the Congress to consider. It appears to reflect a balanced 
immigration policy that makes the most of our diversity while protecting 
the American workforce so that we can better compete in the emerging 
global economy. The administration looks forward to working with 
Congress on this issue.
