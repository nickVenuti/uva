Remarks in a Telephone Conversation Congratulating the Super Bowl 
Champion San Francisco 49ers

January 29, 1995

    The President. Eddie, can you hear me?
    Eddie DeBartolo. Yes, Mr. President, I can.
    The President. It's nice to hear your voice. Congratulations.
    Mr. DeBartolo. Thank you so much, sir.
    The President. I want to say to you and to George and Carmen and to 
all your wonderful players, it was a--the whole season was thrilling for 
all of us, and I think the best thing I can say about the 49ers is, I 
haven't met a single fan anywhere in America who resents all the success 
you've had. And that's a rare thing. And it's a real tribute to you, to 
the coach, and to the players in the way you've won and the way you've 
conducted yourself. We're all happy and proud of you tonight.
    Mr. DeBartolo. Well, Mr. President, I can't thank you enough for 
taking this time, and I know from a very busy schedule. And we're all 
your backers, and I thank you so much from the bottom of my heart.
    The President. Thank you. Congratulations to all of you.
    Mr. DeBartolo. Thank you very much.
    The President. I liked seeing George without his glasses. He looks 
good.

Note: The President spoke at 10 p.m. from the Residence at the White 
House. In his remarks, the President referred to San Francisco 49ers 
owner Eddie DeBartolo, head coach George Seifert, and team president 
Carmen Policy.
