and Human Services regarding the administration of the Radiation Control 
for Health and Safety Act of 1968 during calendar year 1993.
    The report recommends the repeal of section 540 of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act that requires the completion of this annual 
report. All the information found in this report is available to the 
Congress on a more immediate basis through the Center for Devices and 
Radiological Health technical reports, the Radiological Health Bulletin, 
and other publicly available sources. This annual report serves little 
useful purpose and diverts Agency resources from more productive 
activities.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
