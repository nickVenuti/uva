Statement on the Tragedy at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska

September 22, 1995

    Hillary and I were very saddened to learn of the death of the 
American and Canadian service members in the crash of a U.S. Air Force 
AWACS aircraft at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska this morning. Their 
loss reminds us how much we owe those who serve our Nation's Armed 
Forces. Our hearts and prayers go out to the families, friends, and 
loved ones of those who were killed, both in the United States and in 
Canada.
