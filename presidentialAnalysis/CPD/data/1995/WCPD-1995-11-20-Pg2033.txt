Message to the Congress Transmitting Legislation To Compensate 
Furloughed Federal Government Employees

November 16, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:

    In declaring my intention to disapprove House Joint Resolution 122, 
the further continuing resolution for fiscal year 1996, I stated my 
desire to approve promptly a clean extension of the continuing 
resolution that expired on November 13. Accordingly, I am forwarding the 
enclosed legislation that would provide for such an extension. This 
legislation also provides that all Federal employees furloughed during 
the Government shutdown through no fault of their own will be 
compensated at their ordinary rate for the period of the furlough.
    I urge the Congress to act on this legislation promptly and to 
return it to me for signing.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
November 16, 1995.
