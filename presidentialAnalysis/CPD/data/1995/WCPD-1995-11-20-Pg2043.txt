Statement on House of Representatives Action on Budget Reconciliation 
Legislation

November 17, 1995

    Today, the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to 
enact the biggest Medicare and Medicaid cuts in history, unprecedented 
cuts in education and the environment, and steep tax increases on 
working families. I will veto this bill. I am determined to balance the 
budget, but I will not go along with a plan that cuts care for disabled 
children, reduces educational opportunity by cutting college 
scholarships, denies preschool to thousands of poor children, slashes 
enforcement of environmental laws, and doubles Medicare premiums for the 
elderly. We should balance the budget in a way that reflects our values.
