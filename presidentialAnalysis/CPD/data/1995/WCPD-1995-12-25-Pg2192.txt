Message on the Observance of Hanukkah

December 15, 1995

    Warm greetings to all who are celebrating Hanukkah.
    Each year, as the days grow shorter and the nights colder, we 
welcome the return of this Festival of Lights, and each year we find 
fresh meaning in its ageless story of the triumph of the Maccabees. We 
are reminded of God's powerful presence in our lives, strengthening and 
sustaining us in times of struggle. We are inspired to reflect upon the 
meaning of courage, commitment, and faith. We are encouraged to 
acknowledge our blessings--the love of family, the strength of 
community, the hope of peace. We rediscover the wisdom of pausing, in 
the rush and hurry of everyday life, to give joyful thanks for these 
blessings.
    This year, especially, we need such reminders, for with the death of 
Yitzhak Rabin, a great man, a true friend, and a peacemaker was taken 
from our midst. But as families throughout our nation and around the 
world gather to rekindle the flames of the menorah, let us renew our 
faith that God will continue to guide our steps through adversity until 
we can all rejoice in the light of peace.
    Hillary and I extend best wishes for a joyous Hanukkah and a 
wonderful holiday season.
                                            William J. Clinton
