Memorandum on the Combined Federal Campaign

June 28, 1995

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

    I am delighted that Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna 
Shalala has agreed to serve as the chair of the 1995 Combined Federal 
Campaign of the National Capital Area. I ask you to support the campaign 
by personally chairing it in your Agency and appointing a top official 
as your vice chair.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. This year our goal 
again is to raise more than $38 million. Public servants not only 
contribute to the campaign, but assume leadership roles to ensure its 
success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help guarantee another 
successful campaign this year.
                                            William J. Clinton
