Statement on Senate Approval of Dan Glickman as Secretary of Agriculture

March 30, 1995

    I am pleased the Senate today overwhelmingly voted in support of Dan 
Glickman as the new Secretary to the Department of Agriculture.
    Dan Glickman will be a strong voice and advocate for farmers, 
working families, and American agriculture.
    During the past 2 years, the Agriculture Department has broken new 
ground on expanding trade opportunities, developing empowerment zones 
for distressed rural areas, and steamlining a major Federal agency that 
now runs more efficiently. However, our work is not done, and we must 
still tackle other important issues facing rural communities, farmers, 
and ranchers.
    Next month will be especially important as we convene in Ames, Iowa, 
for the National Rural Conference to discuss the development of our 
Nation's economy, jobs, trade, and preservation of the family farm. It 
is important to hear firsthand from ordinary Americans, and I am pleased 
Dan is starting the job with his sleeves rolled up.
