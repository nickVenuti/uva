Statement on the National Crime Rates

November 19, 1995

    The continued decline in our national crime rate shows that the 
efforts by citizens and their police are making a difference. My 1994 
crime bill's putting 100,000 cops on the street, taking assault weapons 
off the street, and cracking down on violent drug crimes. Today, all 
Americans must double their efforts to eliminate the scourge of juvenile 
violence from our communities. This will only be accomplished by more 
parents teaching their children right from wrong.
