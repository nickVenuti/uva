Statement on the Death of Mickey Mantle

August 13, 1995

    When I was growing up in the 1950's, millions of young people like 
me loved watching Mickey Mantle lead the Yankees. As a ballplayer, 
Mickey inspired generations of fans with his power and grit. As a man, 
he faced up to his responsibilities and alerted generations to come to 
the dangers of alcohol abuse. He will be remembered for excellence on 
the baseball field and the honor and redemption he brought to the end of 
his life.
