Message to the Senate Transmitting the Belgium-United States 
Supplementary Extradition Treaty

June 9, 1995

To the Senate of the United States:

    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Supplementary Treaty on 
Extradition Between the United States of America and the Kingdom of 
Belgium to Promote the Repression of Terrorism, signed at Brussels on 
April 27, 1987 (the ``Supplementary Treaty''). Also transmitted for the 
information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with 
respect to the Supplementary Treaty.
    This Supplementary Treaty is designed to facilitate the extradition 
of terrorists, and is similar to the protocols to extradition treaties 
currently in force with other countries, including Australia, Canada, 
Spain, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom. Upon 
entry into force, the Supplementary Treaty will amend the Treaty for the 
Mutual Extradition of Fugitives from Justice, signed at Washington on 
October 26, 1901, as amended by the Supplementary Conventions, signed at 
Washington on June 20, 1935, and at Brussels on November 14, 1963, if 
that Treaty is still in force, or the Extradition Treaty Between the 
United States and Belgium signed at Brussels on April 27, 1987.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Supple-

mentary Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
