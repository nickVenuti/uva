Statement on the Commission on Immigration Reform

September 12, 1995

    I reiterate my earlier congratulation to the Commission on 
Immigration Reform for its hard work on legal immigration reform. The 
Commission has provided the Congress and the Nation with an excellent 
framework to achieve gradual reductions in the level of legal 
immigration. This is a goal and objective I share.
    The Commission's first report on illegal immigration endorsed many 
of the activities my administration has initiated. This report on legal 
immigration also shares many of my principles to guide reform. Our legal 
immigration system must be based on principles that are pro-family, pro-
work, and pro-naturalization. I anticipate working with Congress in a 
spirit of bipartisanship to craft the specific legislation that will put 
these principles in practice.
