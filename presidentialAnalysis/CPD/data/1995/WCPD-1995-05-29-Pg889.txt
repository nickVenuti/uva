To the Congress of the United States:

    I hereby transmit a report concerning emigration laws and policies 
of the Republic of Romania as required by subsections 402(b) and 409(b) 
of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (``the Act''). I have 
determined that Romania is in full compliance with the criteria in 
subsections 402(a) and 409(a) of the Act. As required by Title IV, I 
will provide the Congress with periodic reports regarding Romania's 
compliance with these emigration standards.
