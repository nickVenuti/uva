Statement on the Death of Alfred Eisenstadt

August 24, 1995

    We join today to mourn the death of the dean of photojournalism. 
From the pages of Life magazine to art galleries throughout the world, 
Alfred Eisenstadt, one of the most talented photojournalists of our 
time, has chronicled our country's history through his work.
    His legacy will continue through his photographs for Americans and 
people across the globe to enjoy. Hillary and I extend our deepest 
personal sympathies to his companion Lu Lu Kaye as well as to his family 
and friends.
