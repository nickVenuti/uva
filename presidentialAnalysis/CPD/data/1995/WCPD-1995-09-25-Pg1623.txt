Message on the Observance of Rosh Hashana

September 20, 1995

    Warm greetings to all who are celebrating Rosh Hashana, marking a 
new year of both promise and renewal.
    On this solemn occasion each year, the powerful call of the shofar 
is sounded, summoning Jews around the world to a spiritual reawakening. 
The message of Rosh Hashana--remembrance and redemption for the new 
year--serves as a timeless lesson for all of us as we seek a closer 
relationship with God and work to find deeper meaning in our lives.
    This sacred holiday is also a time for self-examination and an 
opportunity to celebrate God's ongoing creation. Let all who are 
rejoicing in this season of hope also strengthen their resolve to work 
for a better, brighter future.
    Best wishes for a joyous Rosh Hashana and for a new year of peace.
                                                  Bill Clinton
