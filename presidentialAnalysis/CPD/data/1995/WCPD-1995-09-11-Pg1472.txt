    The President. That's good. Promote that man. [Laughter]
    Let me say, first of all, I thank you for the magnificent job that 
you did today. It was thrilling to all the veterans who are here and all 
their family members, and thrilling to the people in the United States 
who saw it on television. I thank you for your service and your devotion 
to your country. I hope you realize just how historic these few days 
are. I hope every one of you has the opportunity to get out and meet 
some of these World War II veterans who were here 50 years before you 
and whose legacy you have carried on so greatly.
    I just want you to know that I, as the President and Commander in 
Chief and as an American citizen, am profoundly grateful to you for your 
service to this country, proud of what you represent, and I'm determined 
to do everything I can to support you, to see that we can, together, do 
our job to preserve our freedom and expand democracy.
    You are terrific. Thank you. God bless you all.

Note: The President spoke at 11:43 a.m. in the lanai of the consolidated
