Statement on the ``Weapons Offenses and Offenders'' Report

November 11, 1995

    These statistics are a chilling reminder to all of us--parents, 
teachers, police officers and elected leaders--that juvenile violence 
remains the number one crime problem in America.
    I am proud of the landmark legislation we have passed to fight the 
scourge of youth violence, such as the juvenile handgun ban and zero-
tolerance for guns in schools. But if we are to win this fight against 
crime and violence, more parents must begin to teach their children 
right from wrong.
    And to anyone who would undo the steps I have taken to fight crime 
and violence in America's streets and on her schoolyards, I say: Look at 
the facts. Now is not the time to weaken our laws.
