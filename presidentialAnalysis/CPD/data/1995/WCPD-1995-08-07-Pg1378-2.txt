Message to the Congress Transmitting the District of Columbia Financial 
Authority Budget

August 4, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with section 106(a) of the District of Columbia 
Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority Act of 
1995, I am transmitting the District of Columbia Financial 
Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority's operating budget 
for FY 1996.
    The Authority's request for its FY 1996 operating budget is $3.5 
million. This budget was developed based on an estimated staffing level 
of 35 full-time employees. After reviewing the budgets and staffing 
levels of other control boards, the Authority believes this staffing 
level is the minimum necessary to carry out its wide range of fiscal, 
management, and legal responsibilities.
    This transmittal does not represent an endorsement of the budget's 
contents.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
August 4, 1995.
