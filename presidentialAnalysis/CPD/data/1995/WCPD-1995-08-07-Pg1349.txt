Statement on Oil and Gas Drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf

July 31, 1995

    The Government today has reached an agreement protecting sensitive 
coastal areas off Florida and Alaska from oil drilling, which has been 
prohibited since 1988, through Democratic and Republican Presidencies.
    Concern for our coasts is part of the common ground we share as 
Americans, not only in the areas protected today but in places as 
different as California, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Jersey, and 
Washington. Once sensitive areas are damaged--beaches, the fishing 
industry, tourism--our natural heritage suffers greatly.
    This settlement is good for the environment, good for taxpayers, 
good for the economy, and fair to the oil companies.
    I am pleased that Secretary Babbitt and Attorney General Reno 
reached this agreement with the oil companies. We celebrate today with 
the citizens of Florida and Alaska, and I pledge continued protection of 
our coasts.
