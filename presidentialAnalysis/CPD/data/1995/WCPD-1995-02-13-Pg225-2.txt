Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the National 
Endowment for the Humanities

February 9, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:

    I am pleased to present to you the Twenty-ninth Annual Report of the 
National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the Federal agency charged 
with fostering scholarship and imparting knowledge in the humanities. 
Its work supports an impressive range of humanities projects.

[[Page 226]]

    These projects can reach an audience as general as the 28 million 
who watched the documentary Baseball, or as specialized as the 50 
scholars who this past fall examined current research on Dante. Small 
local historical societies have received NEH support, as have some of 
the Nation's largest cultural institutions. Students from kindergarten 
through graduate school, professors and teachers, and the general public 
in all parts of the Nation have been touched by the Endowment's 
activities.
    As we approach the 21st century, the world is growing smaller and 
its problems seemingly bigger. Societies are becoming more complex and 
fractious. The knowledge and wisdom, the insight and perspective, 
imparted by history, philosophy, literature, and other humanities 
disciplines enable us to meet the challenges of contemporary life.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
February 9, 1995.
