Statement on the Nomination of Lt. Gen. Charles C. Krulak To Be 
Commandant of the Marine Corps

March 14, 1995

    I am pleased to nominate Lt. Gen. Charles C. Krulak, U.S. Marine 
Corps, for appointment to the grade of general and as Commandant of the 
Marine Corps, succeeding Gen. Carl E. Mundy, Jr., who is retiring.
    I have asked the Secretary of the Navy to announce my decision today 
in ceremonies at Iwo Jima commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 
battle.
    General Krulak currently serves as Commander, U.S. Marine Corps 
Forces Pacific and Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force Pacific. In 
this capacity, he is responsible for Marine Corps units and activities 
throughout the Pacific theater. During his distinguished career, General 
Krulak served two command tours in Vietnam, oversaw the Marine Corps 
logistic efforts during Desert Storm, and was responsible for 
significant and innovative changes in military doctrine and 
organization. He brings to the job of Commandant a dynamic vision of the 
Marine Corps' future, a wealth of experience, and a highly effective 
leadership and managerial style.
    General Krulak assumes the post of Commandant of the Marine Corps at 
an important time in the U.S. Marine Corps' history. I will depend on 
him to continue General Mundy's superb efforts in ensuring that the 
Marine Corps remains fully ready and able in carrying out its important 
responsibilities under our national security strategy.
