Statement on the Death of Helen McLarty

September 18, 1995

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of a 
wonderful woman and good family friend, Helen McLarty.
    I have known Helen McLarty my entire life. She was an exemplary 
citizen and a devoted wife and mother. Like my own mother, she fought a 
long battle against cancer with

courage and perseverance. Throughout her illness, she was a constant 
source of strength to all of those around her.
    In addition to the love and support she gave to her family, Helen 
McLarty was a remarkable citizen whose contributions to her community--
as the first woman to serve on the Arkansas Industrial Development 
Commission and as a partner with her husband in building the McLarty 
Companies into one of the region's largest transportation firms--will 
not be forgotten.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with Helen's sons, Mack and Bud 
McLarty, her grandchildren, and the rest of her family and friends 
during this difficult time.
