Message to the Senate Transmitting a Protocol to the Canada-United 
States Income Tax Convention

April 24, 1995

To the Senate of the United States:

    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification, a 
revised Protocol Amending the Convention Between the United States of 
America and Canada with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Signed 
at Washington on September 26, 1980, as Amended by the Protocols Signed 
on June 14, 1983, and March 28, 1984. This revised Protocol was signed 
at Washington on March 17, 1995. Also transmitted for the information of 
the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the 
revised Protocol. The principal provisions of the Protocol, as well as 
the reasons for the technical amendments made in the revised Protocol, 
are explained in that document.
    It is my desire that the revised Protocol transmitted herewith be 
considered in place of the Protocol to the Income Tax Convention with 
Canada signed at Washington on August 31, 1994, which was transmitted to 
the Senate with my message dated September 14, 1994, and which is now 
pending in the Committee on Foreign Relations. I desire, therefore, to 
withdraw from the Senate the Protocol signed in August 1994.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the revised
