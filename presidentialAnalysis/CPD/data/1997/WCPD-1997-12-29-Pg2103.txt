Statement on the Death of Dawn Steel

December 22, 1997

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Dawn Steel. She 
was a pioneer in the film industry, blazing a trail for a new generation 
of young women, and setting a standard of achievement for all. Our lives 
have been enriched by her talent, and she will be missed. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with her husband, her daughter, and with all her family.
