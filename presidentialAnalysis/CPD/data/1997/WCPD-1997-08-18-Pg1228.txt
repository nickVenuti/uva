Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Line Item Veto of the 
Balanced Budget Act of 1997

August 11, 1997

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel one item 
of new direct spending, as specified in the attached report, contained 
in the ``Balanced Budget Act of 1997'' (Public Law 105-33; H.R. 2015). I 
have determined that this cancellation will reduce the Federal budget 
deficit, will not impair any essential Government functions, and will 
not harm the national interest. This letter, together with its 
attachment, constitutes a special message under section 1022 of the 
Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
report detailing the cancellation was published in the Federal Register 
on August 12.
