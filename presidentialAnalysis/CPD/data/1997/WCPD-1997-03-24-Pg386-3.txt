President's Visit

    Q. Mr. President, what did you think of President Yeltsin's 
conciliatory remarks on his arrival here?
    The President. I was quite encouraged. I felt good about it. I'm 
looking forward to the meeting. And I thank President Ahtisaari for 
making it possible for us to be here.
    Q. Are you finding--how are you finding a bum knee? Is that 
compatible with international diplomacy?
    The President. So far we're doing all right. My knee and I are 
getting around pretty well.
