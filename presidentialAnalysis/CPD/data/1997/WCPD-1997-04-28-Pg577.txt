Statement on the Supreme Court Decision To Expedite Review of the Line 
Item Veto

April 23, 1997

    I am pleased that the Supreme Court has granted the Solicitor 
General's request to provide an expedited review of a lower court ruling 
on the line item veto. The line item veto provides a critical tool for 
the President to strike wasteful spending and tax items from 
legislation. Congress took the correct step giving the President this 
authority, and I was pleased to sign the line item veto into law. It is 
my hope that this expedited ruling will clear up any confusion on this 
matter.
