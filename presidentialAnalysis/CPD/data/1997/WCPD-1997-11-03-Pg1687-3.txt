Statement on House of Representatives Action on             Fast-Track 
Trade Legislation

October 30, 1997

    I applaud Speaker Gingrich for scheduling a vote in the House of 
Representatives for next Friday, November 7, on the renewal of 
traditional trade negotiating authority. I am

grateful for his commitment to move forward and work to secure passage 
of this legislation that is vital to our national interest.
    Renewal of traditional trade negotiating authority, which every 
President has had since 1974, will allow me to negotiate strong trade 
agreements that break down foreign barriers to our goods and services 
and directly benefit American workers and American companies. This 
authority represents a partnership between the President and the 
Congress in support of both American jobs and American leadership in the 
world today. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Speaker 
Gingrich and others in both the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis 
to secure enactment of this legislation this year.
