Statement on the 20th Anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act

October 12, 1997

    On the 20th anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), we 
should all be proud of what that law has meant for low and moderate 
income Americans of all races. Although we still have a long way to go 
in bringing all Americans into the economic mainstream, under CRA the 
private sector has pumped billions of dollars of credit to build 
housing, create, jobs, and restore hope in communities left behind.
