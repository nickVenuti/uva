South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of 
Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains, signed

rates of tax to be applied to various types of income and protection 
from double taxation of income. The Convention also provides for the 
exchange of information to prevent fiscal evasion and sets forth 
standard rules to limit the benefits of the Convention so that they are 
available only to residents that are not engaged in treaty shopping.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
                                            William J. Clinton
