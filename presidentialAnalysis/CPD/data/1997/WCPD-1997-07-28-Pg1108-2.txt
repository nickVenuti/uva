Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Most-Favored-Nation 
Trade Status for Mongolia

July 18, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:

    On September 4, 1996, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Mongolia is in full compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria 
of sections 402 and 409 of

the Trade Act of 1974. This action allowed for the continuation of most-
favored-nation (MFN) status for Mongolia and certain other activities 
without the requirement of an annual waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the 
Congress concerning the emigration laws and policies of Mongolia. You 
will find that the report indicates continued Mongolian compliance with 
U.S. and international standards in the area of emigration.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
July 18, 1997.
