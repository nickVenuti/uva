Statement on the United Nations Security Council Resolution on Iraq

November 12, 1997

    I welcome the prompt, clear, and strong resolution by the United 
Nations Security Council condemning Iraq for obstructing the work of 
international weapons inspectors and defying the will of the 
international community. With one voice, the Security Council has made 
it clear that Iraq's actions are unacceptable; that it must submit to 
investigations into Baghdad's ballistic missile, biological, chemical, 
and nuclear weapons programs; and that sanctions will remain in place 
until Iraq cooperates. For Iraq, there is one simple way out of the box 
Saddam Hussein has put it in: Comply with the will of the international 
community.
