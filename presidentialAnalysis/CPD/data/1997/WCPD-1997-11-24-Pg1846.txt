Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Luxor, Egypt

November 17, 1997

    Earlier today, I called President Mubarak of Egypt to offer our 
Nation's condolences to the families of those killed in the terrorist 
assault at Luxor this morning. The United States deplores and condemns 
this attack against innocent tourists. Once again, we are reminded of a 
painful truth: Terrorism is a global threat. No nation is immune. That 
is why all nations must redouble our commitment to fight this scourge 
together.
