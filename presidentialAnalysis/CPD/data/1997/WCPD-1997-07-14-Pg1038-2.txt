Message to the Senate Transmitting the Luxembourg-United States 
Extradition Treaty

July 8, 1997

To the Senate of the United States:

    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, signed at Washington on October 1, 1996.
    In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the

report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
    This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between 
the law enforcement communities of both countries, and thereby make a 
significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. It 
will supersede, with certain noted exceptions, the Extradition Treaty 
between the United States of America and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg 
signed at Berlin on October 29, 1883, and the Supplementary Extradition 
Convention between the United States and Luxembourg signed at Luxembourg 
on April 24, 1935.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
July 8, 1997.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on
