Paul Tsongas

January 18, 1997

    Paul Tsongas was a great American. He cared deeply about his beloved 
State of Massachusetts and about our country and its future. In a life 
devoted to public service, he set an unparalleled example of integrity, 
candor, and commitment. On behalf of the entire Nation, Hillary and I 
extend to his family our deepest sympathy and our profound gratitude for 
his life and work.
