dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the 
attached report, contained in the ``Departments of Commerce, Justice,

I have determined that the cancellation of this amount will reduce the 
Federal budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government 
functions, and will not harm the national interest. This letter, 
together with its attachment, constitutes a special message under 
section 1022 of the
