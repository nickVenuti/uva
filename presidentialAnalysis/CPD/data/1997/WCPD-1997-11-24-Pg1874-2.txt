Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Line Item Vetoes of the 
Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998

November 20, 1997

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the 
dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the 
attached reports, contained in the ``Department of the Interior and 
Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998'' (H.R. 2107). I have 
determined that the cancellation of these amounts will reduce the 
Federal budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government 
functions, and will not harm the national interest. This letter, 
together with its attachments, constitutes a special message under 
section 1022 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
1974, as amended.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
reports detailing the cancellation were published in the Federal 
Register on November 24.
