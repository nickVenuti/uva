Statement on Senate Action on Campaign Finance Reform Legislation

October 7, 1997

    Today was not the end of this fight for campaign finance reform but 
the beginning. The Republican leadership and a minority of the Senate 
used procedural maneuvers to block the obvious will of a majority of 
United States Senators to support bipartisan campaign finance reform 
legislation. I will fight for this measure as hard as necessary, for as 
long as necessary. And I call on all Senators to realize that the 
bipartisan McCain-Feingold measure is our best chance to move forward 
with reform.
