Statement on the Death of James A. Michener

October 17, 1997

    Hillary and I are greatly saddened by the loss of one of our 
country's most gifted storytellers, James A. Michener. Through his rich 
narratives woven on the grandest scale, Michener made our imaginations 
soar and our history come alive. From the sandy shores of the South 
Pacific to the barren tundra of Alaska, we followed Michener on epic 
journeys through time and place, along the way celebrating such time-
honored virtues as patriotism, courage, and common sense. And even after 
achieving great fame and wealth, Michener never forgot his humble roots. 
He was a major benefactor to colleges and writers' groups, eventually 
donating much of his fortune for the benefit of others. America has lost 
a rich voice and a generous spirit.
