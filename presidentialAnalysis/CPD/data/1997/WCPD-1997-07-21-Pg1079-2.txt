July 16, 1997

    With deep regret, I accept the resignation of Walter Dellinger as 
Solicitor General.

Walter Dellinger has been an outstanding advocate for the American 
people. He has fought tirelessly and courageously for the rights of all 
Americans. He has represented this country in some of the most important 
cases ever decided by the United States Supreme Court, and in each case, 
worked hard to assure that the Court understood the national interest 
and not just the particular interests of the selected few. Walter is one 
of Nation's most brilliant constitutional scholars, and I know his 
students are delighted that he will return to teaching. But we will miss 
his talent, his leadership, his energy, and his sense of justice.
