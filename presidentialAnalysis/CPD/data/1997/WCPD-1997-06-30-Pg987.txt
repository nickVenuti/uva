Statement on the Apprehension of Indicted War Criminal Slavko Dokmanovic

June 27, 1997

    I welcome the news that Slavko Dokmanovic, an indicted war criminal, 
has been apprehended by investigators for the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), working with the UN 
Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES). Dokmanovic was 
one of a group of suspected war criminals who are under sealed 
indictment. He has been transported to The Hague. He will stand trial 
there for his role in the beatings and executions of Croation soldiers 
and civilians taken from a hospital in Vukovar in November 1991.
    I congratulate the ICTY and UNTAES on their successful apprehension. 
The United States continues to support fully the work of the Tribunal to 
bring indicted war criminals to justice. Cooperation with the Tribunal 
by all the parties is a cornerstone of the Dayton Accords.
