Message to the Congress Transmitting Documentation on Most-Favored-
Nation Trade Status for Certain Former Eastern Bloc States

June 3, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:

    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''), with respect to a 
further 12-month extension of authority to waive subsections (a) and (b) 
of section 402 of the Act. This document constitutes my recommendation 
to continue in effect this waiver authority for a further 12-month 
period, and includes my reasons for determining that continuation of the 
waiver authority and waivers currently in effect for Albania, Belarus, 
Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan will 
substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act. I have 
submitted a separate report with respect to the People's Republic of 
China.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
June 3 1997.
