Statement on the Helicopter Tragedy at Fort Bragg, North Carolina

July 9, 1997

    I was saddened to learn today that a U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter 
had crashed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, killing all eight soldiers 
aboard.
    Although nothing can ease the pain of this tragic loss, I want to 
express my deep respect for these patriots who died proudly serving the 
country they loved. These eight soldiers paid the ultimate price for the 
peace we all enjoy.
    I extend my deepest sympathy to the families of these brave soldiers 
and ask that all Americans join us in remembering them in our prayers.
