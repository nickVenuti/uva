Statement on the Death of Peggy Browning

February 28, 1997

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Peggy Browning. 
Through her devotion to the law and determination in encouraging fair 
labor practices, Peggy contributed greatly to constructive and 
harmonious labor relations in this country. Her distinguished career was 
marked by compassion, good judgment, and, especially in recent months, 
courage. Her dedicated service will be sorely missed. Our prayers and 
sympathies are with her family at this time.
