Helsinki

March 21, 1997

Russia and NATO

    Q. President Yeltsin, do you consider NATO a threat to Russia, or 
are you convinced otherwise by now?
    President Yeltsin. Well, I'm not convinced otherwise.
    President Clinton. We'll have a press conference later, guys.
    Q. You guys always give us a surprise when you meet, Mr. President. 
Do you expect any surprises today?
    President Yeltsin. Perhaps through the course of the discussions we 
may have some surprises. We won't have any surprises at the end of the 
discussions.

Note: The exchange began at 9:43 a.m. at the President's Residence. 
President Yeltsin spoke in Russian, and his remarks were translated by 
an interpreter. A tape was not available for verification of the content
