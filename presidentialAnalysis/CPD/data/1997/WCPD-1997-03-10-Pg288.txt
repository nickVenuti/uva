Statement on the Belfast Talks

March 5, 1997

    As the Belfast talks on the future of Northern Ireland recess today 
for the British and local election campaigns, I want to emphasize the 
strong support of the United States for these historic negotiations. 
They offer an unparalleled opportunity for the Northern Ireland 
political parties and the British and Irish Governments to achieve a 
just and lasting settlement to the conflict that has haunted the people 
of Northern Ireland for too long. Violence can have no place in this 
democratic process. For the talks to be inclusive, as they are intended 
to be, the IRA must declare and implement an unequivocal cease-fire.
    Under the skilled chairmanship of Senator George Mitchell and his 
colleagues, the talks have made useful progress. When the talks 
reconvene in June, it is important that they move quickly into 
substantive negotiations. I hope the participants will return to 
Stormont on June 3 determined to work creatively to make real progress. 
If they do, they will have my full support for the negotiations and 
their eventual outcome.

Note: The statement referred to George J. Mitchell, Special Assistant to 
the President for Northern Ireland.
