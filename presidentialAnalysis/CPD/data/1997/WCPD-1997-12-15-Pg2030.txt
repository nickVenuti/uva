Statement on the Indictment of Henry G. Cisneros

December 11, 1997

    Henry Cisneros has a distinguished career of truly dedicated public 
service. As mayor of San Antonio, as Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, and as a wise counselor to me, he always has the interest 
of ordinary people at heart. I have greatly valued his service. This is 
a matter before the courts, so it is not appropriate for me to comment 
further.
