Message to the Congress Transmitting the China-United States Fisheries 
Agreement

July 16, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an 
Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the People's Republic of China Extending the Agreement of 
July 23, 1985, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, 
with Annexes and Agreed Minutes, as amended and extended. This 
Agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at Beijing on June 
6 and July 1, 1996, extends the 1985 Agreement to July 1, 1998.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
People's Republic of China, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
July 16, 1997.
