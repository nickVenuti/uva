Message to the Senate Transmitting the Argentina-United States 
Extradition Treaty

July 30, 1997

To the Senate of the United States:

    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the 
United States of America and the Argentine Republic, signed at Buenos 
Aires on June 10, 1997.
    In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the 
report states, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
    Upon entry into force, this Treaty would enhance cooperation between 
the law enforcement authorities of both countries, and thereby make a 
significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. The 
Treaty would supersede the Extradition Treaty Between the United States 
of America and the Republic of Argentina signed at Washington on January 
21, 1972.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
July 30, 1997.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
July 31.
