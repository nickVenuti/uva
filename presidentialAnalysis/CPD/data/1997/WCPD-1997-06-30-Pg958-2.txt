Statement on Consumer Confidence

June 24, 1997

    Today's Conference Board release, along with the University of 
Michigan's release earlier this month, indicate more good news on the 
economy.
    Today's report shows that Americans are more confident about 
economic conditions than they have been in 28 years. With consumer 
confidence, unemployment, and inflation the best they've been in 
decades, America's economy is the strongest in the world and the best in 
a generation.
    Unemployment is at its lowest level in 24 years, economic growth is 
the highest it has been in a decade, and inflation is the lowest for any 
administration since John F. Kennedy was President. We have already cut 
the deficit 77 percent since 1992, helping spark this remarkable period 
of strong growth and low inflation.
    Now is the time to build on the bipartisan budget agreement, which 
will balance the budget for the first time since 1969, honor our values, 
and help to continue this solid economic performance.
