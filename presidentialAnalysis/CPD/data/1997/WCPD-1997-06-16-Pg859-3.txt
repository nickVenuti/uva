Legislation

June 12, 1997

the people who need this assistance will get it and by ensuring that the 
controversial and extraneous provisions of the bill were dropped. Anyone

those crucial priorities that are beyond dispute. I thank the Congress 
for its willingness to do so, and I hope we can continue to work 
together in that spirit in the weeks and months to come.
