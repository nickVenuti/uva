Statement on Supplemental Disaster Assistance Legislation

June 4, 1997

    In moving ahead on this flawed legislation, the Republican 
leadership is once again delaying the disaster assistance needed by 
people and communities in the Dakotas, Minnesota, and 30 other States. 
With individuals, families, and businesses awaiting the assistance they 
need to rebuild, I urge the Republican leadership to set politics aside 
and pass a clean disaster assistance bill.
    If the Republican majority is set on this course of adding 
contentious and extraneous provisions, they should send me this bill as 
quickly as possible. I will veto it as soon as it arrives and send it 
back so they can send me a clean disaster assistance bill immediately 
that keeps aid flowing to those in need. Americans in need should not 
have to endure this unnecessary delay.
