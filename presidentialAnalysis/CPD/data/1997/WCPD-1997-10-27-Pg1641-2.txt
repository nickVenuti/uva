Statement on Signing the Second Continuing Resolution for Fiscal Year 
1998

October 23, 1997

    I am pleased to have signed into law today House Joint Resolution 
97, the second short-term continuing resolution for fiscal year 1998.
    The resolution provides 1998 appropriations for continuing projects 
and activities of the Federal Government through November 7, 1997, 
except those funded by the five bills that I have already signed into 
law.
    I urge the Congress to approve the remaining 1998 spending bills 
that include the items contained in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement and 
to provide funding for other priority programs. To give the Congress 
time
