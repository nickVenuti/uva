Message to the Congress Transmitting Line Item Vetoes of the Military 
Construction Appropriations Act, 1998

October 6, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the 
dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the 
attached reports, contained in the ``Military Construction 
Appropriations Act, 1998'' (Public Law 105-45; H.R. 2016). I have 
determined that the cancellation of these amounts will reduce the 
Federal budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government 
functions, and will not harm the national interest.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
October 6, 1997.
