Notice--Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations

August 13, 1997

    On August 19, 1994, consistent with the authority provided me under 
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et 
seq.), I issued Executive Order 12924. In that order, I declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States in light of the expiration of the Ex

port Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et 
seq.). Because the Export Administration Act has not been renewed by the 
Congress, the national emergency declared on August 19, 1994, must 
continue in effect beyond August 19, 1997. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12924.
    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
