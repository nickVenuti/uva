Citation for General John M. Shalikashvili, USA

September 30, 1997

    Throughout a remarkable 39-year military career, General 
Shalikashvili has worked tirelessly to improve our Nation's security and 
promote world peace. A steward of freedom, his landmark endeavors 
include Joint Vision 2010; initiation of NATO's Partnership for Peace; 
NATO enlargement--which includes his native Poland; ratification of the 
Chemical Weapons Convention; and successful military operations in 
Bosnia, Haiti, and elsewhere in the world. A strong and thoughtful 
leader, his sound judgment and strategic vision have been instrumental 
in preparing our Armed Forces for the challenges of today and the 21st 
century. For a lifetime of dedicated service, our Nation gratefully 
honors General John Shalikashvili.
                                            William J. Clinton
