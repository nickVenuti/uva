Joint Statement on Migration Adopted by the President of the United 
States and the President of Mexico

May 6, 1997

    The issue of migration of Mexican nationals to the United States is 
a priority on our bilateral agenda. We, the Presidents of the United 
States and Mexico hereby politically commit our respective governments 
to strive to ensure a proper and respectful management of this complex 
phenomenon taking into consideration its diverse causes and economic and 
social consequences in both countries.
    During the last two years, our governments have engaged in 
consultations and exchange of information through many mechanisms and 
have produced significant progress in the bilateral treatment of issues 
such as human rights and consular protection of migrants and efforts to 
combat migrant trafficking. This constructive dialogue should serve as a 
first step leading to specific proposals to manage migration between our 
nations in a mutually beneficial manner.
    In pursuing these proposals, our governments reaffirm a commitment 
to enhanced bilateral cooperation in the management of migration. We 
will be guided by the following principles:
<bullet>    The sovereign right of every State to formulate and enforce 
            its immigration laws in a manner that addresses its national 
            interests, always in accordance with the rules of 
            international law and in pursuit of a spirit of bilateral 
            cooperation;
<bullet>    Full compliance with the objectives of the memorandum of 
            Understanding on Consular Protection of United States and 
            Mexican Nationals, signed on May 7, 1996, especially the 
            respect for human rights of all migrants; and,
<bullet>    Dedication to a comprehensive vision of managing migration 
            and our shared border that turns differences between our 
            nations into sources of strength, and that leads to mutually 
            beneficial economic and social development that preserves 
            family reunification and protects human dignity.
    On the basis of these principles, we, the Presidents of the United 
States and Mexico commit our governments to intensify dialogue and to 
accelerate efforts to achieve the following goals:
<bullet>    Explore ways to strengthen mechanisms and fora for 
            consultation and cooperation on migration and consular 
            protection that the two governments have established at the 
            national and local level;
<bullet>    Protect the rights of migrants, pursue vigorously the 
            administration of justice in situations in which migrants 
            and bor

            der communities register complaints concerning unlawful 
            actions, and respect due process and constitutional 
            guarantees in the implementation of immigration laws;
<bullet>    Ensure the implementation of safe and orderly procedures for 
            the repatriation of migrants;
<bullet>    Design and implement new ways to reduce violence along the 
            border and to protect innocent victims of traffickers from 
            the dangers of crossing in mountainous and desert terrain, 
            including a vigorous educational and public information 
            campaign to advise families on both sides of the border of 
            the hazards of crossing in those areas;
<bullet>    Combat trafficking in migrants and forging of documents and, 
            to that end, develop effective mechanisms of exchange of 
            information and cooperation, with full respect for the 
            sovereignty of each country;
<bullet>    Achieve a comprehensive approach on the migration phenomenon 
            between the two countries through scientific and cooperative 
            studies that contribute to a bilateral understanding of this 
            issue.
    We, the Presidents of the United States and Mexico, affirm our 
governments' political will to strive to fulfill a vision of our shared 
border in the twenty-first century as a place that supports and depends 
on building communities of cooperation rather than of conflict. In 
pursuance of this vision, our governments will work together to expand 
upon the foundation of progress made through joint planning and 
cooperation during the last two years in certain border areas. Both 
administrations will intensify efforts to achieve the following goals:
<bullet>    Encourage binational strategic planning activities that seek 
            to design new integrated approaches to mutually beneficial 
            economic, social, environmental, and cultural development in 
            border communities;
<bullet>    Support and expand public and private partnerships in 
            developing cross border interests and activities, and in 
            pursuing shared interests on either side of the border;
<bullet>    Intensify the dialogue on financing mechanisms that promote 
            and implement cross border development projects;
<bullet>    Test new ways to design infrastructure and community 
            development projects that provide a dignified approach to 
            public safety in border communities;
<bullet>    Explore new approaches to managing temporary travel between 
            border communities, consistent with the laws of each nation, 
            recognizing the economic, social and family benefits of 
            vigorous cross border exchange; and,
<bullet>    Promote effective management of ports of entry to foster 
            orderly movement of traffic of goods and people, and to 
            reduce the waiting times for daily commuters and other 
            commercial vehicles.
    We, the Presidents of the United States and Mexico, call on the 
relevant agencies of both administrations to report to us in one year, 
through the Binational Commission, on the progress made towards the 
better management of the migration phenomenon and the transformation of 
our border into a model area of bilateral cooperation.
