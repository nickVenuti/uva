Message to the House of Representatives Returning Without Approval 
Legislation To Override of a Line Item Veto

November 13, 1997

To the House of Representatives:

    I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 2631, ``An Act 
disapproving the cancellations transmitted by the President on October 
6, 1997, regarding Public Law 105-45.''
    Under the authority of the Line Item Veto Act, on October 6, 1997, I 
canceled 38 military construction projects to save the taxpayers $287 
million. The bill would restore all of the 38 projects.
    The projects in this bill would not substantially improve the 
quality of life of military service members and their families, and most 
of them would not likely use funds for construction in FY 1998. While 
the bill does restore funding for projects that were canceled based on 
outdated information provided by the Department of Defense, I do not 
endorse restoration of all 38 projects.
    The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress to 
restore funding for those projects that were canceled as a result of 
data provided by the Department of Defense that was out of date.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
November 13, 1997.
