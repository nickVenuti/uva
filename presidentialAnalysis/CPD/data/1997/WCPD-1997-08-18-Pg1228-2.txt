Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting Line Item Vetoes of the 
Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997

August 11, 1997

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel two 
limited tax benefits, as specified in the attached reports, contained in 
the ``Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997'' (Public Law 105-34; H.R. 2014). I 
have determined that each of these cancellations will reduce the Federal 
budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government functions, and 
will not harm the national interest. This letter, together with its 
attachments, constitutes a special message under section 1022 of the 
Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
report detailing the cancellation was published in the Federal Register 
on August 12.
