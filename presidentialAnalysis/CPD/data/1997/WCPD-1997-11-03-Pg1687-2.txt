Statement on Campaign Finance Reform

October 30, 1997

    I am very pleased that the Senate has agreed to schedule a vote on 
campaign finance reform. This will pave the way for the first up-or-down 
vote ever on the McCain-Feingold bill. At long last, we have an 
opportunity to give the American people the kind of elections they 
deserve. I want to commend the entire Democratic caucus and a few brave 
Republicans, whose steadfastness has now produced the first real 
opportunity to enact campaign finance reform.
