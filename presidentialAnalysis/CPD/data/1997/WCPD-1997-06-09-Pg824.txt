Statement on the Oklahoma City Bombing Trial

June 2, 1997

    I cannot comment on the jury's verdict, but I will say that this is 
a very important and long overdue day for the survivors and families of 
those who died in Oklahoma City. And I am very, very proud of the work 
of Attorney General Janet Reno, the prosecutors, the FBI, and the ATF.
    Two years ago, I spoke to the families of 168 people who lost their 
lives at the Murrah Federal building. I told them that though they had 
lost much, they had not lost everything--and they had not lost America. 
I pledged then and I pledge now that we will stand with them for as many 
tomorrows as it takes. Today I say to the families of the victims, no 
single verdict can bring an end to your anguish, but your courage has 
been an inspiration to all Americans. Our prayers are with you.
