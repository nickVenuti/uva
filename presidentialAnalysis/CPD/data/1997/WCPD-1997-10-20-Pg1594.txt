Letter to Congressional Leaders on a Line Item Veto of the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations Act, 1998

October 16, 1997

Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Mr. President:)

    In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the 
dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the 
attached report, contained in the ``Treasury and General Government 
Appropriations Act, 1998'' (Public Law 105-61; H.R. 2378). I have 
determined that the cancellation of this amount will reduce the Federal 
budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government functions, and 
will not harm the national interest. This letter, together with its 
attachment, constitutes a special message under section 1022 of the 
Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
reports detailing the cancellations were published in the Federal 
Register on October 17.
