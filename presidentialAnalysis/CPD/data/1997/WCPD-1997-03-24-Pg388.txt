President's Visit

    Q. President Clinton, what are the prospects for common ground on 
this NATO issue?
    The President. I'm looking forward to the meeting. I think we'll 
work something out; I hope we will. We have had 11 meetings. We've 
worked hard together, and I'm glad to see President Yeltsin looking so 
fit and well.
    Q. How are you doing, President Clinton?
    The President. Great.

Note: The exchange began at 7:05 p.m. in the Yellow Room at the 
Presidential Palace as part of a photo opportunity with Finnish 
President Ahtisaari and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. A tape was not
