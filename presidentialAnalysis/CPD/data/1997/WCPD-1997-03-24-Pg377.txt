Statement on the Murder of John Slane in Northern Ireland

March 17, 1997

    I am deeply saddened by the murder last Friday of John Slane in 
Belfast. Our sympathy goes out to Mr. Slane's family and friends. This 
horrific killing deserves universal condemnation. I hope the British 
authorities will quickly identify who is responsible.
    As I have said so many times, nothing worth having in Northern 
Ireland can be achieved by killing and maiming, terror, and threats. The 
people of Northern Ireland deserve a future of peace and prosperity 
unmarred by brutality and fear in their daily lives. I urge the people 
of both communities to make known in every way they can their 
repudiation of violence by any group, for any reason. I will continue to 
stand with those who stand for peace, today as we commemorate the saint 
who brought the message of peace to Ireland, and every day.
