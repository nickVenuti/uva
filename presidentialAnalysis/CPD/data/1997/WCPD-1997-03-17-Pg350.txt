Statement on Senate Confirmation of Federico Pena as Secretary of Energy

March 12, 1997

    I want to applaud the Senate today for its strong vote of support 
for Federico Pena to serve as our Nation's new Energy Secretary. As 
Transportation Secretary, Federico Pena built consensus among 
communities, business, and government and streamlined operations to reap 
benefits for all taxpayers.
    With this record, I am confident that Secretary Pena has the skill, 
experience, and dedication to lead the Energy Department to meet its 
central challenges--to broaden America's energy resources, to promote a 
safer, more secure world, and to help to create a brighter economic 
future for all Americans.
