Statement on the Death of Jimmy Stewart

July 2, 1997

    America lost a national treasure today. Jimmy Stewart was a great 
actor, a gentleman, and a patriot. We will always remember his rich 
career of great performances that spanned several decades and 
entertained generations of Americans.
    Like all Americans, Hillary and I will miss him greatly, but his 
works live on, and for that we can all be grateful.
