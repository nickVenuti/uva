Message to the Senate Transmitting the France-United States Extradition 
Treaty

July 9, 1997

To the Senate of the United States:

    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the 
United States of America and France, signed at Paris on April 23, 1996.
    In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the 
report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
    This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between 
the law enforcement communities of both countries. It will thereby make 
a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts.
    The provisions in this Treaty, which includes an Agreed Minute, 
follow generally the form and content of extradition treaties recently 
concluded by the United States.

    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
July 9, 1997.
