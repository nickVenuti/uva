Memorandum on the 1997 Combined Federal Campaign

July 28, 1997

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: 1997 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area

    I am delighted that the Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater 
has agreed to serve as the chair of the 1997 Combined Federal Campaign 
of the National Capital Area. I ask you to support the campaign by 
personally chairing the campaign in your agency and appointing a top 
official as your vice chair.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. This year our goal 
is to raise more than $38 million. Public servants not only contribute 
to the campaign, but assume leadership roles to ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help guarantee another 
successful campaign this year.
                                            William J. Clinton
