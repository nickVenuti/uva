Statement on Senate Action on the Balanced Budget Amendment

February 26, 1997

    I have made clear my concerns about the balanced budget amendment, 
and I am pleased that Senator Torricelli has made the difficult decision 
to oppose that measure.
    Now it's time to get down to the hard work of balancing the budget. 
I look forward to working with both Republicans and Democrats in 
Congress to enact a plan that balances the budget in 5 years while 
protecting education and other critical investments in America's future.
