Message to the Congress Transmitting Line Item Vetoes of the Department 
of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998

November 1, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the 
dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the 
attached reports, contained in the ``Department of Transportation and 
Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998'' (Public Law 105-66; H.R. 
2169). I have determined that the cancellation of these amounts will 
reduce the Federal budget deficit, will not impair any essential 
Government functions, and will not harm the national interest.

The White House,
November 1, 1997.
