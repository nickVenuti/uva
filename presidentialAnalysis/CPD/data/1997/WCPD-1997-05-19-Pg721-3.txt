Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process Initiative by Prime 
Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom

May 16, 1997

wants to see inclusive talks, but it will invite Sinn Fein to the 
negotiating table only on the basis of an unequivocal cease-fire. And he

basis. I urge Sinn Fein to take up this offer, and I pray it will bring 
about an end to the violence for good. Now is the time to open a new 
chapter in the history of this tragic conflict and achieve through 
dialog and negotiation the lasting settlement the people of Northern 
Ireland want and deserve.
