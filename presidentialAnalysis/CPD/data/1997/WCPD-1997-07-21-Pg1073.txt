Statement on Northern Ireland

July 12, 1997

    I welcome the decision of the Orange Order and its local lodges to 
voluntarily call off and reroute the contentious parades scheduled for 
this weekend. In choosing not to risk confrontation, the members of the 
Orange Order have taken a significant step. I hope that the people of 
both communities redouble their efforts to reach accommodation on other 
contentious parades in a spirit of goodwill and generosity and reject 
the inexcusable violence that we saw in Northern Ireland today.
    The Orange Order's decision, and the warm welcome that has greeted 
it, confirm my conviction that the people of Northern Ireland want and 
deserve an end to violence and confrontation. The people of Northern 
Ireland have the United States unwavering support to build on this 
moment of hope to seek a lasting settlement to the conflict that has 
divided them for far too long.
