Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Submitting Trade Agreements With Colombia, Panama, and South Korea to Congress October 3, 2011 The series of trade agreements I am submitting to Congress today will make it easier for American companies to sell their products in South Korea, Colombia, and Panama and provide a major boost to our exports. These agreements will support tens of thousands of jobs across the country for workers making products stamped with three proud words: Made in America. We've worked hard to strengthen these agreements to get the best possible deal for American workers and businesses, and I call on Congress to pass them without delay, along with the bipartisan agreement on trade adjustment assistance that will help workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition.
