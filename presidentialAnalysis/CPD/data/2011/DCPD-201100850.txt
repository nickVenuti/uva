Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Senate Passage of Legislation Providing Tax Credits To Aid Businesses Hiring Veterans November 10, 2011 Today Republicans and Democrats in the Senate did the right thing and passed tax credits that will encourage businesses to hire America's veterans. Tomorrow our Nation will commemorate Veterans Day and honor the service and the sacrifice of all who have worn the uniform of the United States of America. No veteran who fought for our Nation should have to fight for a job when they come home, and I urge the House to pass these tax credits as well so I can sign them into law. I also urge Congress to pass additional jobs proposals in the weeks ahead to help the millions of other Americans who are still looking for work. NOTE: The statement referred to H.R. 674.
