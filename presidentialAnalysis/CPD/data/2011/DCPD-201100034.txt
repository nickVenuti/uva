Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Senator G. Kent Conrad's Decision Not To Seek Reelection January 18, 2011 For more than 20 years, Kent Conrad has been a tireless advocate for the people of North Dakota. During that time, he has shown an unmatched dedication to putting our country on a sound fiscal path and a commitment to meeting our Nation's energy challenges. He has also been a good friend to me, and while I am saddened to see him leave the Senate, I look forward to working with him during the next 2 years on the important issues facing our country. Michelle and I thank Senator Conrad for his leadership and service and wish him and his family all the best in their future endeavors. Categories: Statements by the President : Conrad, Sen. G.
