Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the Death of Elouise P. Cobell October 17, 2011 Michelle and I were saddened to hear about the passing of Elouise Cobell yesterday. Elouise spoke out when she saw that the Interior Department had failed to account for billions of dollars that they were supposed to collect on behalf of more than 300,000 of her fellow Native Americans. Because she did, I was able to sign into law a piece of legislation that finally provided a measure of justice to those who were affected. That law also creates a scholarship fund to give more Native Americans access to higher education and give tribes more control over their own lands. Elouise helped to strengthen the government-to-government relationship with Indian Country, and our thoughts and prayers are with her family and all those who mourn her passing. NOTE: The statement referred to Public Law No. 111â€“291, the Claims Resolution Act of 2010, which was approved on December 8, 2010.
