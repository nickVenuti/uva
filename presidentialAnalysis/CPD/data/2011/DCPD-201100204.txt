Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the Death of Geraldine A. Ferraro March 26, 2011 Michelle and I were saddened to learn about the passing of Geraldine Ferraro. Geraldine will forever be remembered as a trailblazer who broke down barriers for women and Americans of all backgrounds and walks of life. Whether it was as a public school teacher, assistant district attorney, Member of Congress, or candidate for Vice President, Geraldine fought to uphold America's founding ideals of equality, justice, and opportunity for all. And as our Ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, she stood up for those ideals around the world. Sasha and Malia will grow up in a more equal America because of the life Geraldine Ferraro chose to live.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to her husband John Zaccaro, her children and grandchildren, and their entire family. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Ferraro, Geraldine.
