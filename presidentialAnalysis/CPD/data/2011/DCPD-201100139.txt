Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Remarks During a Tour of Miami Central High School in Miami, Florida March 4, 2011 Thank you so much, everybody. Look, I could not be prouder of you. I couldn't be prouder of your teacher and your principal. The reason we came down here is because this is a model of what's possible in so many schools across the country that were having trouble just a few years ago. Because of great leadership, we've been able to turn it around. And I can just tell that the way everybody is presenting themselves and the seriousness with which you take your work, you guys are all going to succeed, and you'll help our country succeed too. So all right? Keep it up. Okay. NOTE: The President spoke at 3:25 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Renina Turner, principal, Miami Central High School.
