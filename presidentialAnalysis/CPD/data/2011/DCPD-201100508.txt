Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Representative Dale E. Kildee's Decision Not To Seek Reelection July 15, 2011 For more than 30 years, Dale Kildee has never forgotten the people he represents or what drives his work in the United States Congress. As a teacher, State legislator, and Congressman, Dale made fighting for the families he represents his top priority and worked to improve education in Michigan and across the Nation. We will miss Dale's voice in Congress. Michelle and I wish him well and join the people of Michigan in thanking him for his many years of service.
