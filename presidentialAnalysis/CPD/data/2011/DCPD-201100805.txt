Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the United States District Court Approval of the Settlement in the Pigford II Class-Action Lawsuit on Discrimination by the Department of Agriculture October 28, 2011 The U.S. District Court's approval of the settlement between the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and plaintiffs in the Pigford II class-action lawsuit is another important step forward in addressing an unfortunate chapter in USDA's civil rights history. This agreement will provide overdue relief and justice to African American farmers and bring us closer to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on. I especially want to recognize the efforts of Secretary Vilsack and Attorney General Holder, without whom this settlement would not have been reached.
