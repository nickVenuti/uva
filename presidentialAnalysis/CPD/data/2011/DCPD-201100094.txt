Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the Situation in the Middle East February 18, 2011 I am deeply concerned by reports of violence in Bahrain, Libya, and Yemen. The United States condemns the use of violence by governments against peaceful protesters in those countries and wherever else it may occur. We express our condolences to the family and friends of those who have been killed during the demonstrations. Wherever they are, people have certain universal rights, including the right to peaceful assembly. The United States urges the Governments of Bahrain, Libya, and Yemen to show restraint in responding to peaceful protests and to respect the rights of their people.
