Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Senator E. Benjamin Nelson's Decision Not To Seek Reelection December 27, 2011 I want to thank Senator Nelson for his years of service representing the people of Nebraska first as Governor and then, for more than a decade, in the United States Senate. Over the course of his career, Ben's commitment to working with both Democrats and Republicans across a broad range of issues is a trait far too often overlooked in today's politics. Michelle and I commend Ben for his service and wish him and his family well in the future. Categories: Statements by the President : Nelson, Sen. E. Benjamin, decision not to seek reelection.
