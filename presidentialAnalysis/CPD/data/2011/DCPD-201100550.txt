Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Congressional Action on Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Legislation August 4, 2011 I'm pleased that leaders in Congress are working together to break the impasse involving the FAA so that tens of thousands of construction workers and others can go back to work.
