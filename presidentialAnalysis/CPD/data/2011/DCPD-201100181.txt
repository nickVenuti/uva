Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the Situation in Yemen March 18, 2011 I strongly condemn the violence that has taken place in Yemen today and call on President Salih to adhere to his public pledge to allow demonstrations to take place peacefully. Those responsible for today's violence must be held accountable. The United States stands for a set of universal rights, including the freedom of expression and assembly, as well as political change that meets the aspirations of the Yemeni people. It is more important than ever for all sides to participate in an open and transparent process that addresses the legitimate concerns of the Yemeni people and provides a peaceful, orderly, and democratic path to a stronger and more prosperous nation.
