Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the United States District Court Approval of the Settlement in the Keepseagle Class-Action Lawsuit on Discrimination by the Department of Agriculture April 28, 2011 Today the U.S. District Court approved the settlement reached by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice with the plaintiffs in the Keepseagle class-action lawsuit. This is yet another important step forward in addressing an unfortunate chapter in USDA's civil rights history. This settlement would not have been reached without the leadership of Secretary Vilsack and Attorney General Holder, and I want to thank them both for their hard work on behalf of Native American farmers. Today's approval of the settlement will help strengthen our nation-to-nation relationship with Indian Country and reinforce the idea that all citizens have a right to be treated fairly by their Government.
