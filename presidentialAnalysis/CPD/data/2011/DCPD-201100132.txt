Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Senator Daniel K. Akaka's Decision Not To Seek Reelection March 2, 2011 Danny Akaka answered the call to serve right after high school by joining the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II. When he returned to Honolulu, he continued to serve the people of Hawaii as an educator before embarking on more than three decades of distinguished service in both Houses of Congress. Danny spent his career fighting for our troops, veterans and their families, and for the rights of Native Hawaiians. He worked tirelessly to reform Wall Street and to make sure that consumers and small-business owners are treated fairly in our system. His voice in the Senate will be missed. Michelle and I would like to join the people of Hawaii in saying mahalo to Danny for his lifetime of service and offer both him and Millie our best wishes for the future.
