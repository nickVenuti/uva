Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the Election of Janice K. Hahn to the United States House of Representatives July 13, 2011 I want to extend my congratulations to Congresswoman-elect Janice Hahn for her victory in California's 36th Congressional District. Janice and I both believe that in order to win the future, we need to create jobs and grow our economy and pursue a balanced approach to deficit reduction. In Congress, Janice will continue to fight for the people of the South Bay and add another chapter to her family's long history of dedicated service to the people of California. I look forward to working with her. Categories: Statements by the President : Hahn, Janice K., election to U.S. House of Representatives. Names: Hahn, Janice K.
