Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Notice—Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran November 7, 2011 On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701–1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in Iran. Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is still under way, the national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2011. Therefore, consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year this national emergency with respect to Iran. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. BARACK OBAMA The White House, November 7, 2011. [Filed with the Office of the Federal Register, 11:15 a.m., November 8, 2011] NOTE: This notice was published in the Federal Register on November 9.
