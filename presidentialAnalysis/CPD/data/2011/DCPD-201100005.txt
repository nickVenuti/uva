Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the Resignation of Robert L. Gibbs as White House Press Secretary January 5, 2011 For the last 6 years, Robert has been a close friend, one of my closest advisers, and an effective advocate from the podium for what this administration has been doing to move America forward. I think it's natural for him to want to step back, reflect, and retool. That brings up some challenges and opportunities for the White House, but it doesn't change the important role that Robert will continue to play on our team.
