Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation to Continue Federal Government Appropriations March 2, 2011 I'm pleased that Democrats and Republicans in Congress came together and passed a plan that will cut spending and keep the Government running for the next 2 weeks. But we cannot keep doing business this way. Living with the threat of a shutdown every few weeks is not responsible, and it puts our economic progress in jeopardy. That's why I'm calling on Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress to begin meeting immediately with the Vice President, my Chief of Staff, and Budget Director so we can find common ground on a budget that makes sure we are living within our means. This agreement should cut spending and reduce deficits without damaging economic growth or gutting investments in education, research, and development that will create jobs and secure our future. This agreement should be bipartisan, it should be free of any party's social or political agenda, and it should be reached without delay. NOTE: The statement referred to White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley. It also referred to H.J. Res. 44.
