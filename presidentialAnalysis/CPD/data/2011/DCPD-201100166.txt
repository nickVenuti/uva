Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan and the Tsunami Warning for the Pacific March 11, 2011 Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan, particularly those who have lost loved ones in the earthquake and tsunamis. The United States stands ready to help the Japanese people in this time of great trial. The friendship and alliance between our two nations is unshakeable and only strengthens our resolve to stand with the people of Japan as they overcome this tragedy. We will continue to closely monitor tsunamis around Japan and the Pacific going forward, and we are asking all our citizens in the affected region to listen to their State and local officials, as I have instructed FEMA to be ready to assist Hawaii and the rest of the U.S. States and Territories that could be affected.
