Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the Iranian Government's Release of Shane Bauer and Joshua Fattal September 21, 2011 I welcome the release of Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal from detention in Iran and am very pleased that they are being reunited with their loved ones. The tireless advocacy of their families over these 2 years has won my admiration and is now coming to an end with Josh and Shane back in their arms. All Americans join their families and friends in celebrating their long-awaited return home. We are deeply grateful to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, the Swiss Government, and to all our partners and allies around the world who have worked steadfastly over the past 2 years to secure the release of Shane and Josh.
