Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Government Reforms in Bahrain February 27, 2011 I welcome the announcement by King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa about making important changes to the cabinet and restating his commitment to reform. The United States supports the national dialogue initiative led by Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa and encourages a process that is meaningful, inclusive, nonsectarian, and responsive to the people of Bahrain. The dialogue offers an opportunity for meaningful reform and for all Bahrainis to forge a more just future together. As a longstanding partner of Bahrain, the United States continues to believe that Bahrain's stability will be enhanced by respecting the universal rights of the people of Bahrain and reforms that meet the aspirations of all Bahrainis.
