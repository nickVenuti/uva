Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Governor Christine O. Gregoire of Washington's Decision Not to Seek Reelection  June 13, 2011 I applaud Governor Gregoire for her decades of outstanding service to the people of Washington. From Seattle to Pullman, Gov. Gregoire has demonstrated relentless determination in her efforts to foster economic growth, strengthen the communities she serves, and improve the lives of millions of Americans. As a fierce advocate for American businesses, she continues to work tirelessly to promote American goods, open up new markets, and strengthen American businesses abroad. As chairwoman of the National Governors Association, Gov. Gregoire not only fosters strong bipartisanship among her colleagues, she helps build commonsense solutions to some of our Nation's toughest problems. Michelle and I, along with the people of Washington, will miss her outstanding leadership and thank her for her years of service. Categories: Statements by the President : Gregoire, Gov.
