Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on the United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity June 17, 2011 Today for the first time in history, the United Nations adopted a resolution dedicated to advancing the basic human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons. This marks a significant milestone in the long struggle for equality and the beginning of a universal recognition that LGBT persons are endowed with the same inalienable rights and entitled to the same protections as all human beings. The United States stands proudly with those nations that are standing up to intolerance, discrimination, and homophobia. Advancing equality for LGBT persons should be the work of all peoples and all nations. LGBT persons are entitled to equal treatment, equal protection, and the dignity that comes with being full members of our diverse societies. As the United Nations begins to codify and enshrine the promise of equality for LGBT persons, the world becomes a safer, more respectful, and more humane place for all people.
