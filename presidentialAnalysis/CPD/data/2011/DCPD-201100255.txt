Administration of Barack Obama, 2011 Statement on Signing the Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011 April 14, 2011 Today I was pleased to take another step to relieve unnecessary burdens on small businesses by signing H.R. 4 into law. Small-business owners are the engine of our economy, and because Democrats and Republicans worked together, we can ensure they spend their time and resources creating jobs and growing their business, not filling out more paperwork. I look forward to continuing to work with Congress to improve the tax credit policy in this legislation, and I am eager to work with anyone with ideas about how we can make health care better or more affordable. NOTE: H.R. 4, approved April 14, was assigned Public Law No. 112â€“9.
