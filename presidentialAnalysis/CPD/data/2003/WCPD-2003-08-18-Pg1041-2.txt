Memorandum on Determination on Turkmenistan

August 8, 2003

 Presidential Determination No. 2003-31

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

Subject: Determination on Turkmenistan

    Pursuant to Presidential Determination 98-7 of December 5, 1997, 
Turkmenistan was found to be not in violation of paragraph (1), (2), or 
(3) of subsection 402(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2432(a) and 
2439(a)) (the ``Act'') or paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection 
409(a) of the Act. That determination with respect to Turkmenistan is no 
longer in effect.
    Consistent with section 402(c)(2)(A) of the Act, I determine that a 
waiver by Executive Order of the application of subsections (a) and (b) 
of section 402 of the Act with respect to Turkmenistan will 
substantially promote the objectives of section 402.
    On my behalf, please transmit this determination to the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and to the President of the Senate.
    You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the 
Federal Register.
                                                George W. Bush
