    As a mark of respect for the memory of James Strom Thurmond, the 
longest serving member and former President pro tempore of the United 
States Senate, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me as 
President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States of America, that on the day of his interment, the flag of 
the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and 
upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval 
stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the 
District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its 
Territories and possessions until sunset on such day. I also direct that 
the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United 
States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities 
abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and

    In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day 
of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
seventh.
