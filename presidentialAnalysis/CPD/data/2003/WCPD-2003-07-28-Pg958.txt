Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Reallocation of 
Funds Previously Transferred From the Emergency Response Fund

July 23, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    In order to continue the necessary and critical responses to the 
September 11 terrorist attacks, I am notifying the Congress of my intent 
to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency Response 
Fund (ERF).
    At this time, $5 million of ERF funds will be transferred to the 
Food and Drug Administration to support activities to improve the 
security of the food supply.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
