Statement on House of Representatives Action on Homeland Security 
Legislation

June 24, 2003

    I commend the House of Representatives for acting quickly to approve 
funds for our continued effort to strengthen homeland security and 
protect the American people. I'm particularly pleased that the House 
bill supports my request to help train, equip, and prepare first-
responders across our Nation. The bill also supports important core 
functions of the newly created Department of Homeland Security, 
including border security, infrastructure protection, and information 
analysis.
