Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Medicare Reform 
Legislation

November 22, 2003

    The House's historic passage of the bipartisan Medicare bill brings 
seniors one step closer to a modern Medicare system, one that includes 
prescription drugs and choices for seniors. I applaud the House for 
meeting our obligations to America's seniors. Now it is time for the 
Senate to act. I urge the Senate to pass this good piece of legislation 
so that I can sign it into law.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
