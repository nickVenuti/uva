Statement on the Death of Frank O'Bannon

September 13, 2003

    Frank O'Bannon was a dedicated public servant and a good and decent 
man. He led a distinguished career, including service in the Air Force, 
in the Indiana State senate, and as Lieutenant Governor. Since being 
sworn in as Governor of Indiana in 1997, he has served the people of his 
State with integrity and devotion. Laura joins me in sending our 
thoughts and prayers to his wife, Judy, and their family.
