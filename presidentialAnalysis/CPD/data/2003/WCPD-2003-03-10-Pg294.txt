Statement on the Release of Low Income Home Energy Assistance Funding

March 4, 2003

    I am pleased to announce today that the Secretary of the Department 
of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson is releasing $150 million in 
Low Income Home Energy Assistance funding. This additional funding will 
provide much needed help for families struggling with rising heating 
costs. This new money, combined with emergency funds released in 
January, will help keep many Americans warm during this cold winter.
