Exchange With Reporters in Santa Fe, New Mexico

President's Golf Game

    Q. How's the game?
    The President. I need a lot of work.
    Q. Better than yesterday?
    The President. Equally as feeble--equally as feeble. It's been a 
fabulous weekend here in Santa Fe. I'm now ready to get back to work. 
Got some travel to do tomorrow, be talking to the country about the need 
for an economic stimulus package. And then we're going to go see, 
Tuesday afternoon, we're going to go to see some of the tornado sites. 
And it will give me a chance to tell the people who've suffered great 
loss how much a lot of the Nation prays for them and how we're concerned 
about them. But it's been a fabulous experience here in a wonderful part 
of the world. The hospitality by the people here has been just great. I 
really appreciate it.
    Happy Mother's Day, everybody.

Note: The exchange began at 5:45 p.m. at the golf course at Las 
Campanas.
