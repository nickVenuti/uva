Statement on the Establishment of the Iraqi Governing Council

July 14, 2003

    The establishment of the Iraqi Governing Council is an important 
step forward in the ongoing transition from ruthless dictatorship to a 
free and democratic Iraq with Iraqis determining their own future. We 
look forward to working with the Council as it moves toward a democratic 
and prosperous Iraq, at peace with its neighbors.
