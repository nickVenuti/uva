Statement on AIDS Relief Legislation

May 1, 2003

    The fight against AIDS is a moral imperative our great Nation must 
confront decisively and boldly.
    I applaud the House of Representatives for acting quickly to pass 
historic legislation that is consistent with the Emergency Plan for AIDS 
Relief that I announced earlier this year. Today's action is an 
important step toward providing critically needed treatment and care for 
millions of people suffering from AIDS and proven prevention programs 
for millions more who are at risk.
    Time is of the essence, and I urge the Senate to act quickly so that 
we can turn the tide against this disease and give the hope of life to 
millions of people in the world's most afflicted countries.
