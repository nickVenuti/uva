Statement on Congressional Action on the Budget Resolution

April 11, 2003

    I commend House and Senate negotiators for their hard work and 
success in ensuring that the Congress has a budget resolution in place 
that reflects my priorities of winning the war against terrorism, 
protecting Americans at home, and strengthening economic growth. I 
particularly congratulate Chairmen Nickles and Nussle for their 
leadership, not only in accomplishing agreement but in doing so ahead of 
schedule. The compromise budget resolution funds our priorities, 
restrains spending, and provides opportunity for passage of a robust 
jobs-and-growth package. I commend the House for passing this measure 
and look forward to prompt passage in the Senate.
