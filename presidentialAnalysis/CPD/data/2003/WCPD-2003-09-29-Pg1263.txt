Statement on Congressional Passage of the Department of Homeland 
Security Appropriations Act, 2004

September 24, 2003

    To win the war on terrorism, we are staying on the offensive abroad 
and protecting Americans at home. I applaud Congress for passing the 
Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. These funds will 
help make Americans and their families even safer through stronger 
border enforcement, improved transportation security, and continued 
support for police, firefighters, and emergency-response teams. I look 
forward to signing this legislation.
