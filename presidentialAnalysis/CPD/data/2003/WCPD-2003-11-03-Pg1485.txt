Statement on Senate Confirmation of Michael O. Leavitt as Administrator 
of the Environmental Protection Agency

October 28, 2003

    I am pleased the Senate acted today to confirm Governor Mike Leavitt 
as my new Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Governor 
Leavitt is an exceptional leader who shares my commitment to reaching 
out across partisan lines to get things done. I know he will work 
closely with me to build upon my administration's initiatives to make 
our air and water cleaner, protect the land, and use technology to 
improve our environment while our economy grows and creates jobs. I 
thank Chairman Inhofe and Senator Reid for their leadership in ensuring 
Governor Leavitt's confirmation.
