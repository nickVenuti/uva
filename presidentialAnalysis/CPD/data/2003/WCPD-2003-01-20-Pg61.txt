Letter to Congressional Leaders on Modifying Duty-Free Treatment Under 
the Generalized System of Preferences To Include Afghanistan

January 10, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Afghanistan to the 
list of beneficiary developing countries and to the list of least-
developed beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System 
of Preferences (GSP). I have carefully considered the criteria 
identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. 
In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to 
extend GSP beneficiary developing country and least-developed 
beneficiary developing country benefits to Afghanistan.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
