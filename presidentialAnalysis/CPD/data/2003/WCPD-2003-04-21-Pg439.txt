Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Supplementary Budget Request for the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission

April 11, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed request for the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). This request would provide an 
additional $18.3 million to the EEOC in FY 2003. It is needed for the 
EEOC to avoid furloughing its entire workforce for as many as 19 days in 
FY 2003, which would significantly disrupt its ability to conduct its 
enforcement responsibilities.
    The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
his comments and observations.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
