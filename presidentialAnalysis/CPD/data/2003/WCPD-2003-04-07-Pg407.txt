Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Giving 
Notification of Intent To Transfer Emergency Response Funds to the 
National Commission on Terrorist Attacks

April 3, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    In order to continue the investigation into the September 11, 2001, 
terrorist attacks on the United States, I am notifying the Congress of 
my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency 
Response Fund (ERF).
    At this time, $9 million of ERF funds will be transferred to the 
National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States to 
ensure that it has the necessary resources to investigate fully the 
terrible tragedy of September 11, 2001. My Administration is strongly 
committed to the purpose and mission of the Commission and will continue 
to cooperate with the Commission in accordance with applicable law to 
help ensure that it succeeds. I expect that the Commission's final 
report will contain important recommendations.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his 
comments and recommendations.
    Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
