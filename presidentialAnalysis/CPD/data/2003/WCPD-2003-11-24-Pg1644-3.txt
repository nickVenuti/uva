Statement on Signing the Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003

November 18, 2003

    Today, I have signed into law S. 313, the ``Animal Drug User Fee Act 
of 2003.'' The Act is designed to expedite the animal drug development 
process, while continuing to ensure the safety and effectiveness of 
animal drugs.
    Section 4(a) of the Act purports to require the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services to submit legislative recommendations to the Congress 
and to establish procedures by which the Secretary must formulate such 
recommendations. The legislative power does not extend to requiring the 
Executive submit legislative recommendations to the Congress nor to 
specifying procedures by which the Executive must formulate any 
legislative recommendations that the Executive makes. The executive 
branch shall execute section 4(a) in a manner consistent with the 
Constitution's exclusive commitments to the President of the authority 
to submit for the consideration of the Congress such measures as he 
judges necessary and expedient and the
