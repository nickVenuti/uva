Radio Remarks to the People of Cuba on Cuban Independence Day

May 20, 2003

    Today, Cubans around the world celebrate May 20th, Cuban 
Independence Day. On behalf of the people of the United States, I send 
greetings to the Cuban community. My hope is for the Cuban people to 
soon enjoy the same freedoms and rights that we do. Dictatorships have 
no place in the Americas. May God bless the Cuban people who are 
struggling for freedom. Thank you.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded in Spanish at 9:50 a.m. on 
May 16 in the Cabinet Room at the White House for later broadcast on 
Radio Marti. The Spanish language transcript and an English translation 
were released by the Office of the Press Secretary on May 20. This text 
follows the English translation.
