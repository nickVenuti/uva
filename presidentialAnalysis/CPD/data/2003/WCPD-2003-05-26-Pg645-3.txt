Statement on House of Representatives Passage of an Unemployment 
Insurance Extension

May 22, 2003

    I commend the House of Representatives for passing an unemployment 
insurance extension that will continue important additional assistance 
for American workers as our economy recovers. Combined with action on 
the jobs-and-growth package, Congress has taken important steps to help 
America's unemployed workers. I also urge Congress to pass legislation 
to create the innovative Re-employment Accounts I proposed to give 
certain unemployed individuals additional benefits and incentives to 
find work. I look forward to signing these measures into law.
