Statement on Senate Action on Legislation To Implement the Jobs-and-
Growth Package

May 16, 2003

    I commend the Senate for its bipartisan passage of a jobs-and-growth 
package that includes all of the components of my original plan. By 
including a measure to completely abolish the double taxation of 
dividends, the Senate has demonstrated that they are committed to 
creating as many jobs as possible for American workers. The Senate bill 
also speeds income tax rate cuts for individuals and families, increases 
the child credit, provides marriage penalty relief, and increases 
expensing for small businesses.
    Jobs are on the line, and I look forward to working with the full 
Congress to pass a robust economic growth plan. I call on Congress to 
resolve their differences quickly so that I can sign a bill that will 
help create jobs, boost take-home pay, and spur economic growth.
