Statement on Senate Passage of the ``Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of Iraq and 
Afghanistan, 2004''

November 3, 2003

    I commend Congress for providing vital funds to support our mission 
and our troops deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. These 
resources, coupled with the growing assistance of international donors,

will provide essential support to make Iraq more secure and to help the 
Iraqi people transition to self-government. The funds will also enable 
us to continue our efforts to help Afghanistan become a peaceful, 
democratic, and prosperous nation that contributes to regional 
stability.
    Our country is being tested. Those who seek to kill coalition forces 
and innocent Iraqis want America and its coalition partners to run so 
the terrorists can reclaim control. The strong bipartisan show of 
support for this bill underscores that America and the world are united 
to prevail in the central front in the war on terror by helping build a 
peaceful, democratic, and prosperous Iraq.
    I thank Chairmen Stevens and Young for their efforts and look 
forward to signing this bill.
