Statement on the Death of
Paul Simon

December 10, 2003

    Laura and I were saddened to learn of the death of former Senator 
Paul Simon. Paul Simon contributed significantly to America as an Army 
special agent, newspaper publisher, Member of the United States Senate 
and House of Representatives, and author and teacher. He will be missed 
by the many people in Illinois and throughout the country whose lives he 
touched and improved. Laura and I send our condolences to his family and 
many friends.
