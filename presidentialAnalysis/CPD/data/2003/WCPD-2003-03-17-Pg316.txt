Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    Consistent with the resolution of advice and consent to ratification 
of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production,

Biotechnology, the legitimate commercial activities and interests of 
chemical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical firms in the United States 
were not harmed significantly by the limitations of the Convention on 
access to, and production of, those chemicals and toxins listed in 
Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
