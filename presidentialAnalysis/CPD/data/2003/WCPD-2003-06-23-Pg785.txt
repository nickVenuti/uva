Statement on Congressional Action on Volunteer Service and National 
Service Legislation

June 19, 2003

    I commend Congress, particularly Senators Bond and Mikulski and 
Representatives Boehner and Hoekstra, for working with my administration 
and taking swift action to pass the ``Strengthen AmeriCorps Program 
Act.''

[[Page 786]]

The bill establishes accounting guidelines for the Corporation for 
National and Community Service that will help put AmeriCorps on a sound 
financial footing. It is also the essential first step toward maximizing 
enrollment this year to benefit the nonprofit organizations that count 
on AmeriCorps members to offer help and hope to people in communities 
across the country.
    I hope Congress will continue to show strong support for my effort 
to help every American answer the call to volunteer service and act 
quickly to strengthen and expand national service by passing the 
``Citizen Service Act.''
