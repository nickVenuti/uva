Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Reallocation of 
Funds Previously Transferred From the Emergency Response Fund

July 31, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    In order to continue responses necessary as a result of the 
September 11th terrorist attacks, I am notifying the Congress of my 
intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency 
Response Fund (ERF).
    At this time, $1.2 million of ERF funds will be transferred to the 
United States Trade Representative to support increased security at 
international trade negotiations.

     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
