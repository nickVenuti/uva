Dear __________ :

    Consistent with section 306(c)(2) of the Cuban Liberty and

``Act''), I hereby determine and report to the Congress that suspension 
for 6 months beyond August 1, 2003, of the right to bring action under 
title III of the Act is necessary to the national interests of the 
United States and will expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba.
    Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
