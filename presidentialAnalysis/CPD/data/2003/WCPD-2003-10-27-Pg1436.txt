Letter to President Hu Jintao on China's First Human Space Mission

October 19, 2003

Dear Mr. President:

    On behalf of the American people, I congratulate you and the Chinese 
people on the successful completion of China's first human space 
mission. I was pleased to learn that Lieutenant Colonel Yang Liwei 
returned safely to earth. This mission was an historic triumph for the 
Chinese people and a milestone in the continued exploration of space.
    The United States of America warmly welcomes the People's Republic 
of China's achievement in becoming only the third country to launch an 
astronaut into space, and wishes you continued success in this endeavor.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
