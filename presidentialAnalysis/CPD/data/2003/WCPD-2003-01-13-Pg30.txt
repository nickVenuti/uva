Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Israel

January 5, 2003

    Today terrorists struck again in Israel, murdering and injuring 
scores of civilians in Tel Aviv. I condemn this attack in the strongest 
possible terms. It is a despicable act of murder, and I express my 
condolences to the Government and people of Israel and especially to the 
families of the victims. Secretary Powell has already spoken to Prime 
Minister Sharon to convey the condolences of the American people. The 
United States remains determined to continue our efforts toward peace in 
the Middle East, a goal that the terrorists seek to destroy. All who 
genuinely seek peace in the region must join in the effort to stop 
terror. The United States is determined to continue the global fight 
against terrorism and against the terrorist organizations that conduct 
operations such as the murders in Israel today.

Note: In the statement, the President referred to Prime Minister Ariel 
Sharon of Israel.
