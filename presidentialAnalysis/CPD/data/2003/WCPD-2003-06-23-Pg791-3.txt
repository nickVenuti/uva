previous submission covered February 1 through March 31, 2003.
    The United States remains committed to finding a just and lasting 
settlement for Cyprus. Serious efforts continued during this reporting 
period to persuade the two sides on Cyprus to resume negotiations under 
the auspices of the United Nations Good Offices Mission for Cyprus, on 
the basis of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's proposed 
settlement plan. As in the past, U.S. officials, including Secretary of 
State Powell, Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman, Special Cyprus 
Coordinator Thomas G. Weston, Ambassador to Cyprus Michael Klosson, 
Ambassador to Turkey Robert Pearson, and Ambassador to Greece Thomas 
Miller provided intensive diplomatic support to this process.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard G. Lugar, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations.
