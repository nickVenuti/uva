Statement on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Decision on the 
State's Ban of Same Sex Marriages

November 18, 2003

decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court violates this 
important principle. I will work with congressional leaders and others 
to do what is legally necessary to defend the sanctity of marriage.
