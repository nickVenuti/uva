Statement on the Death of Steve Young

January 10, 2003

    Laura and I are saddened by the news of the passing of Steve Young, 
national president of the Fraternal Order of Police. Steve made 
important contributions to our country as a police officer, president of 
the Fraternal Order of Police, and as a member of the Homeland Security 
Advisory Council. Steve was a true hero for his dedication to ensuring 
the safety of our communities. He was a great friend and an honorable 
and loyal man.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult 
time.
