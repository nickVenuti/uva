Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Assistance to 
Azerbaijan

March 28, 2003

Dear _____ :

    On January 17, 2003, I exercised my authority to extend the waiver 
of section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act, concerning assistance to 
Azerbaijan. In accordance with paragraph (g)(6) of the heading 
``Assistance for the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union'' in 
title II of the Kenneth M. Ludden Foreign Operations, Export Financing, 
and Related Programs Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 
107-115), I am providing a report prepared by my Administration that 
concerns assistance provided pursuant to this waiver. As required, the 
report describes the status of:
<bullet>    All training and assistance provided to the Government of 
            Azerbaijan pursuant to the extension of the waiver of 
            section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act;
<bullet>    The military balance between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the 
            impact of U.S. assistance on that balance; and
<bullet>    Negotiations for a settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
            conflict and the impact of U.S. assistance on those 
            negotiations.
    My Administration remains fully committed to continue working with 
the Congress and all concerned parties to bolster peace, prosperity, and 
freedom in the South Caucasus.
    Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
