Statement on the Earthquake in Turkey's Bingol Province

May 3, 2003

    I extend my condolences to those injured and to the families of the 
victims of the recent earthquake in Turkey's Bingol Province. I am 
particularly saddened by the number of children who were killed and 
injured. The thoughts and prayers of the American people are with those 
directly affected by this tragedy and with the entire Turkish nation. 
The United States stands ready to help in any way possible.
