Statement on Senate Action on the Nomination of Miguel A. Estrada To Be 
United States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit

February 11, 2003

    Last week, the Senate began floor consideration of the nomination of 
Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Estrada's 
nomination was first submitted to the Senate in May 2001--almost 2 years 
ago. Miguel Estrada is a well-qualified and well-respected nominee who 
enjoys the bipartisan support of a majority of Senators. Fairness 
demands that he receive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. I urge 
the Senate to act quickly and allow for an up-or-down vote on this 
worthy candidate.
