Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation To Prohibit 
Human Cloning

February 27, 2003

    Today's resounding bipartisan vote in the House demonstrates concern 
for the profound moral and social issues posed by human cloning. Like 
most Americans, I believe human cloning is deeply troubling, and I 
strongly support efforts by Congress to ban all human cloning. We must 
advance the promise and cause of medical science, including through 
ethical stem cell research, yet we must do so in ways that respect human 
dignity and help build a culture of life. I urge the Senate to act 
quickly on legislation banning all human cloning.
