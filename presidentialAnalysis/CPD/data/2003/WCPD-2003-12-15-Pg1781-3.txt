Statement on the Death of
Bob Bartley

December 10, 2003

    Bob Bartley was a giant of journalism. His extraordinary 
contributions to America as an author, editor, and columnist helped 
shape our times. I was pleased to award him the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom, our highest civil honor, in recognition of his enormous impact 
on the intellectual and political life of our Nation. Laura joins me in 
sending condolences to Edith and his daughters, family, colleagues, and 
friends.
