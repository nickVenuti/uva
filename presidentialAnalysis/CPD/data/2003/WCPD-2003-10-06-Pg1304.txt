Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Legislation Banning 
Partial-Birth Abortion

October 2, 2003

    I applaud the House for passing the ban on partial-birth abortion so 
soon after the Congressional conferees completed their work. Today's 
action is an important step that will help us continue to build a 
culture of life in America. I look forward to the Senate passing this 
legislation so that I can sign this very important bill into law.
