Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Reallocation of 
Funds Previously Transferred From the Emergency Response Fund

September 30, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    In order to continue responses necessary as a result of the 
September 11th terrorist attacks, I am notifying the Congress of my 
intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency 
Response Fund (ERF).
    At this time, $290 million of ERF funds will be transferred to the 
Department of State to accelerate a variety of initiatives already 
underway in Afghanistan.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
