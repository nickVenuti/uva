Statement on the Report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board

August 26, 2003

    Today the Columbia Accident Investigation Board released its report 
on the tragic accident that claimed the lives of seven brave astronauts. 
These men and women assumed great risk in service to all humanity. On 
behalf of a grateful Nation, I once again recognize their sacrifices and 
those of their loved ones. Their service will never be forgotten.
    Our Nation also owes its appreciation to Admiral Harold Gehman, Jr. 
(retired) as well as the other 12 members of the Columbia Accident 
Investigation Board. As Board Chair, Admiral Gehman and his team have 
worked tirelessly over the past seven months conducting an exhaustive 
review of the circumstances surrounding this accident. The next steps 
for NASA under Sean O'Keefe's leadership must be determined after a 
thorough review of the entire report, including its recommendations.

    Our journey into space will go on. The work of the crew of the 
Columbia and the heroic explorers who traveled before them will 
continue.
