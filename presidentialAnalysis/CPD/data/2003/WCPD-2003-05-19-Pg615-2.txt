Statement on Senate Action on Legislation To Implement the Emergency 
Plan for AIDS Relief

May 16, 2003

    With today's vote in the United States Senate, Congress has given 
the hope of life to millions of people in countries most afflicted by 
AIDS. This historic legislation will enable us to provide critical 
treatment and care for millions who suffer and greatly expand successful 
prevention programs to help those at risk.
    I look forward to this legislation reaching my desk as soon as 
possible so we can begin to turn the tide in the fight against AIDS.
