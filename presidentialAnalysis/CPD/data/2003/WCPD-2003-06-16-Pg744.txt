Statement on the Death of Don Regan

June 10, 2003

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Don Regan. He leaves behind 
a lifetime of service and achievement, in both the private and public 
sector. He served his country with distinction. Don was a devoted 
husband, father, and grandfather and will be sorely missed. We send our 
deepest sympathies to Ann and the entire Regan family.
