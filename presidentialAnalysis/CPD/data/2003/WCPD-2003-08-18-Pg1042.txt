Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on the Extension 
of Normal Trade Relations Status for Certain Former Eastern Bloc States

August 8, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby submit an updated report to the Congress, prepared by my 
Administration, consistent with sections 402(b) and 409(b) of the Trade 
Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2432(b) and 2439(b)), concerning the 
emigration laws and policies of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, 
Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and 
Uzbekistan. The report indicates continued compliance of these countries 
with international standards concerning freedom of emigration, with the 
exception of Turkmenistan. In light of new developments, I am submitting 
a waiver for Turkmenistan.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the

Senate. This item was not received in time for publication in the
