Statement on Congressional Action on the Supplementary Budget Request To 
Ensure Domestic Safety During Operation Iraqi Freedom

April 12, 2003

    I am pleased that Congress moved quickly and with strong bipartisan 
support to pass my request for our military and to bolster our homeland 
defenses during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The world is witnessing the 
liberation of Iraq and the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Iraqi 
people as a new day begins in their country. This legislation includes 
the resources necessary to win the war and help secure enduring freedom 
and democracy for the Iraqi people. I look forward to working with the 
Congress as we make progress in the war and in providing aid to the 
people of Iraq.
