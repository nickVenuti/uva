Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting Proposed Legislative 
Changes To Implement the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement

July 3, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    On June 6, 2003, the United States Trade Representative signed the 
United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement on behalf of the United States. 
Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 2002 (Public 
Law 107-210), I am submitting a description of the changes to existing 
laws, prepared by my Administration, that would be required to bring the 
United States into compliance with that Agreement.
    I look forward to working with the Congress in developing 
legislation to implement this important Free Trade Agreement.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
