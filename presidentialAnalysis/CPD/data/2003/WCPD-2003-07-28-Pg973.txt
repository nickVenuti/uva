Remarks at the Korean War Memorial

July 25, 2003

    I'm here to honor those who served in Korea. There is a very 
profound statement here at this moving memorial. It says, ``Freedom is 
not free.'' And today we honor those--this weekend we honor those who 
served in the cause of freedom in the Korean war.
    This memorial is--and those who served in Korea also remind us of 
the challenges we face today, and it gives us a chance to reflect on the 
sacrifices that are being made on behalf of freedom today. And our 
Nation will be eternally grateful for the men and women who serve today, 
as we are for those who have served in the past.

Note: The President spoke at 7:10 a.m. A tape was not available for
