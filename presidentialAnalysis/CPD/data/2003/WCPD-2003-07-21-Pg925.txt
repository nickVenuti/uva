Statement on House of Representatives Action on the ``Project BioShield 
Act of 2003''

July 16, 2003

    In my State of the Union Address, I outlined a major research and 
production effort called Project BioShield to better protect the 
American people against possible bioterrorist attacks. I commend the 
House for passing the ``Project BioShield Act of 2003.'' This 
legislation will help spur the development and availability of next 
generation countermeasures against biological, chemical, nuclear, and 
radiological weapons. I urge the Senate to act on this very important 
legislation.
