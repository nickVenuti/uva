Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Defense 
Authorization Conference Report

November 7, 2003

    I commend the House for passing the Defense Authorization conference 
report and showing strong bipartisan support for America's national 
security, our troops, and their families. This bill includes my request 
for a third straight pay raise, more resources for equipment and 
training, and quality of life improvements so that our military 
continues to be the finest fighting force in the world.
    The legislation also makes good progress toward transforming and 
modernizing our military so that it is best prepared to protect 
Americans.
    Finally, I am pleased that the House has resolved the issue of 
concurrent receipt for military retirees in a fair and responsible 
manner.
