Statement on Senate Passage of the ``Healthy Forests Restoration Act''

October 30, 2003

    I commend the Senate for passing the ``Healthy Forests Restoration 
Act.'' The bipartisan support for this commonsense legislation 
demonstrates that we are united in our goal of returning our Nation's 
forests to health by eliminating unnatural overgrowth and promoting 
early community involvement in forest management planning.
    Restoring forest health is important to the safety of our 
communities and to the protection of wildlife, endangered species, water 
supplies, and forest resources. I urge the House and Senate to quickly 
resolve the differences in their bills so that I can sign this important 
legislation and we can fully implement my Healthy Forests Initiative.
