Statement on Signing the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and 
Development Act

December 3, 2003

    Today, I have signed S. 189, the ``21st Century Nanotechnology 
Research and Development Act.'' The Act authorizes appropriations for 
research in nanoscience, nanoengineering, and nanotechnology research 
and other related activities.
    Several provisions of the Act, including sections 2(d)(2), 3(c)(1), 
4(d), and 5(d), purport to call for executive branch officials to submit 
to the Congress proposals for legislation, including funding 
legislation. The executive branch shall implement these provisions in a 
manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to 
supervise the unitary executive branch and to recommend for the 
consideration of the Congress such measures as the President judges 
necessary and expedient.
    The executive branch shall construe section 2(b)(4)(E) of the Act in 
a manner consistent with the Government's obligation under the Due 
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution to ensure 
equal protection of the laws.
                                                George W. Bush
The White House,
December 3, 2003.

Note: S. 189, approved December 3, was assigned Public Law No. 108-153.
