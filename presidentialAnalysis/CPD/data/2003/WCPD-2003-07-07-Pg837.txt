Statement on the Death of Katharine Hepburn

June 29, 2003

    Katharine Hepburn delighted audiences with her unique talent for 
more than six decades. She was known for her intelligence and wit and 
will be remembered as one of the Nation's artistic treasures. Laura 
joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers to her family.
