New York City

    President Bush. It's my honor to visit again with my very close 
friend, a great friend of our country, Jose Maria Aznar. Jose Maria is a 
very strong leader who's got a vision that's based upon the principles 
of human dignity and freedom.
    And we'll spend time talking about Iraq. We're both convinced and 
strongly believe that our goals in Iraq are the right goals, and we'll 
accomplished the goals.
    He's a steadfast friend, and I'm so proud to be with you again.
