Statement on the Earthquake in Algeria

May 22, 2003

    On behalf of the American people, I extend condolences to the people 
of Algeria for the terrible losses caused by yesterday's earthquake. I 
was deeply saddened to learn of the hundreds of deaths, the many 
injuries, and the major damage in towns east of Algiers and in the 
capital city. Our prayers are for the victims, their families, and the 
entire Algerian nation. The United States stands ready to help.
