 Statement on Senate Confirmation of William Donaldson as Chairman of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission

 February 13, 2003

     I applaud the Senate for acting quickly to confirm William 
Donaldson to be the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In this new role, he will continue to crack down on corporate 
wrongdoing, work to protect investors, and restore confidence in our 
capital markets. I also thank Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and the 
Senate leadership and commend them for their efforts.
