Statement on the Reelection of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel

January 29, 2003

    I congratulate Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on his victory in 
Israel's elections yesterday. The friendship between the United States 
and Israel, and our commitment to Israel's security, remain firm. I look 
forward to continuing to work with Prime Minister Sharon and his new 
government in the search for peace and security for all Israelis and all 
Palestinians.
