Medicare Reform Legislation

    Because of key votes in the United States Senate today, we're moving 
closer to Medicare reform, a reform package that will make the system 
modern, make sure our seniors have prescription drug coverage, better 
choices.
    I want to commend the Senate for moving the modernization bill 
forward. I look forward to them completing their work and getting a bill 
to my desk that I can sign. Modernizing Medicare will make the system 
better and will enable us to say to millions of seniors, we've kept our 
promise to America's seniors.
    Thank you all.
