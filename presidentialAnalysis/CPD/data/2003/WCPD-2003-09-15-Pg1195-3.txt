Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Certain Terrorist Attacks

September 10, 2003

To the Congress of the United States:

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), 
provides for

[[Page 1196]]

the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the 
anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the 
Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. 
Consistent with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register the 
enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to the 
terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001, is to 
continue in effect for an additional year.
    The terrorist threat that led to the declaration on September 14, 
2001, of a national emergency continues. For this reason, I have 
determined that it is necessary to continue in effect after September 
14, 2003, the national emergency with respect to the terrorist threat.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
