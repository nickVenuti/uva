Statement on the Death of David Brinkley

June 12, 2003

    David Brinkley was a pioneer of broadcast journalism. He was 
respected for his integrity, admired for his candor and wit, and 
distinguished by an exceptional career that spanned more than a half 
century. Laura joins me in offering our heartfelt condolences to Susan 
and the entire Brinkley family.
