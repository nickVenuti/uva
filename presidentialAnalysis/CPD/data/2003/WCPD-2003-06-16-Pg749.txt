Terrorist Bombing in Jerusalem

    Today there was a terrible bombing in Jerusalem. I send my heartfelt 
condolences to those who suffered and lost life.
    It is clear there are people in the Middle East who hate peace, 
people who want to kill in order to make sure that the desires of Israel 
to live in secure and peace don't happen, who kill to make sure the 
desires of the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority and others of 
a peaceful state living side by side with Israel do not happen.
    To the people in the world who want to see peace in the Middle East, 
I strongly urge all of you to fight off terror, to cut off money to 
organizations such as Hamas, to isolate those who hate so much that 
they're willing to kill to stop peace from going forward. I strongly 
condemn the killings, and I urge and call upon all of the free world, 
nations which love peace, to not only condemn the killings but to use 
every ounce of their power to prevent them from happening in the future.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:40 a.m. in Grant Park. In his remarks, 
he referred to Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) of the 
Palestinian Authority. A tape was not available for verification of the
