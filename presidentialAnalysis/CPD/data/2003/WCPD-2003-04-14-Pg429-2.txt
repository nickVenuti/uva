Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Comprehensive Energy 
Legislation

April 11, 2003

    I commend the House for passing comprehensive and balanced energy 
legislation. The House legislation will increase America's energy 
independence by diversifying our sources of renewable energy, expanding 
new technology, and increasing environmentally responsible exploration. 
This bill is a major step forward in the effort to secure our Nation's 
energy future, in keeping with my National Energy Policy. I look forward 
to prompt Senate action and to working to ensure that fiscally 
responsible legislation to reduce our reliance on foreign sources of 
energy can be brought to my desk.
