Statement on the Death of
Bob Stump

June 24, 2003

    Congressman Bob Stump lived a distinguished life of service as a 
World War II veteran, an Arizona State legislator, and a United States 
Congressman. He was a gifted leader who remained true to his principles 
and made an indelible mark on those who were fortunate enough to know 
him. As one of the few Members of Congress who served as chairman of 
both the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Armed Services 
Committee, he was admired for his tireless efforts on behalf of the men 
and women in uniform. Laura joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers 
to Nancy and the entire Stump family during this difficult time.
