Statement on Senate Passage of Partial-Birth Abortion Legislation

October 22, 2003

    I applaud the Senate for joining the House in passing the ban on 
partial-birth abortion. This is very important legislation that will end 
an abhorrent practice and continue to build a culture of life in 
America. I look forward to signing it into law.
