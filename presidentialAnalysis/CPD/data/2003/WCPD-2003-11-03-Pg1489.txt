Notice--Continuation of Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction

October 29, 2003

    On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, President Clinton 
declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, 
biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the 
means of delivering such weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued 
Executive Order 13094 to amend Executive Order 12938 to respond more 
effectively to the worldwide threat of proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means of delivering such weapons. Because the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering 
them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the 
national emergency first declared on November 14, 1994, must continue in 
effect beyond November 14, 2003. Consistent with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as amended.
    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 October 29, 2003.
