Statement on the Award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Shirin Ebadi

October 11, 2003

    The United States congratulates Shirin Ebadi on receiving the Nobel 
Peace Prize--a first for an Iranian and for a Muslim woman. The prize 
recognizes her lifetime of championing human rights and democracy. I 
strongly support the Iranian people's aspirations for freedom and their 
desire for democracy. The future of Iran must be decided by the people 
of Iran. Americans look forward to the day when a free Iran stands as an 
example of tolerance, prosperity, and democracy in the Middle East and 
around the world.
