Statement on Legislation To Implement the Community and Faith-Based 
Initiative

February 5, 2003

    I applaud the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of 
Senators Grassley and Baucus, for moving quickly on a key component of 
bipartisan faith-based legislation sponsored by Senators Santorum and 
Lieberman. Today's action brings us one step closer to creating 
incentives for Americans to donate more to charities, many of which are 
facing tough financial times. We must also work to level the playing 
field for community and faith-based organizations that provide effective 
social services to our fellow citizens who are in need. I look forward 
to working closely with the Senate and House to improve the legislation 
to get a strong, bipartisan faith-based bill on my desk as soon as 
possible. Together, we can help encourage acts of compassion that can 
transform our Nation, one heart and one soul at a time.
