Memorandum on the 2003 Combined Federal Campaign

August 15, 2003

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: 2003 Combined Federal Campaign

    I am delighted that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, 
Mel R. Martinez, has agreed to serve as the Chair of the 2003 Combined 
Federal Campaign (CFC) of the National Capital Area. I ask you to 
enthusiastically support the CFC by personally chairing the campaign in 
your agency and appointing a top official as your Vice Chair.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. Public servants not 
only contribute to the campaign but also assume leadership roles to 
ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help positively influence 
thousands of employees and will guarantee another successful campaign.
                                                George W. Bush
