Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Department of 
Defense Appropriations Bill

July 8, 2003

    I commend the House for passing the Department of Defense 
Appropriations bill. The House action will help strengthen and transform 
our military to keep America safe from the threats of this new era. The 
bill also continues my long-term commitment to improving the quality of 
life for our troops and their families through higher pay and good 
benefits. I am pleased the House has acted quickly and in a fiscally 
responsible manner, and I look forward to continuing to work with the 
Congress to ensure that we have the resources necessary to support our 
troops.
