    In accordance with provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-554), and the Consolidated Appropriations 
Resolution, 2003 (Public Law 108-7), I hereby request and make available 
$38,100,000 for the Department of Homeland Security's Counterterrorism 
Fund. Of these funds, I hereby designate $28,748,918 as an emergency 
requirement pursuant to Public Law 106-554.
    These funds would allow the Department of Homeland Security to

that is used to identify potential threats posed by international cargo 
shipments and international passengers.
