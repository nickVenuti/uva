Statement on the Death of
Althea Gibson

September 29, 2003

    Althea Gibson rose above segregation and discrimination to become a 
world-class tennis player. In 1957 and 1958, she won both Wimbledon and 
the United States Open, displaying her remarkable spirit, determination, 
and skill. In breaking the racial barrier in championship tennis, she 
furthered America's progress in recognizing individuals for their 
character and abilities, not their skin color. Laura and I send our 
prayers and condolences to the family and friends of Althea Gibson.
