Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Request for Funding for the Corporation for National and Community 
Service

March 4, 2003

Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed request for the 
Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS). The request is 
needed to liquidate legitimate prior-year obligations for eligible 
participants in the AmeriCorps program, to complete the implementation 
of a comprehensive corrective action plan developed by CNCS to 
strengthen financial management, and to provide flexibility to support 
more than 50,000 AmeriCorps members in FY 2003. This request will not 
increase my FY 2004 request.
    The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
his comments and observations.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
