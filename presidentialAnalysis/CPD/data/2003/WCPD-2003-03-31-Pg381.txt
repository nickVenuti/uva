Statement on Congressional Action on the Budget Resolution

March 26, 2003

    I commend the Senate Republican leadership for its commitment to 
jobs and growth and for acting quickly to pass a budget resolution, in 
sharp contrast to last year when the Senate did not even pass such a 
resolution. It is unfortunate that the full Senate has failed to pass a 
budget that provides for my entire economic growth-and-job creation 
plan. The House budget took the bold steps necessary to boost our 
economy, and we will work to ensure that the final House-Senate budget 
provides the growth measures American workers deserve.
