Statement on Congressional Action on Comprehensive Energy Legislation

November 14, 2003

    I applaud the House and Senate for reaching agreement on a 
comprehensive energy bill. America will be safer and stronger with a 
national energy policy that will help keep the lights on, the furnaces 
lit, and the factories running. A good energy bill is part of my six-
point economic plan to create the conditions for job creation and a 
sustained recovery. By making America less reliant on foreign sources of 
energy, we also will make our Nation more secure. I commend the Congress 
for its hard work on this important issue.
