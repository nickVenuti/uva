Notice--Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Certain 
Terrorist Attacks

September 12, 2007

    Consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency I 
declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463, with respect to 
the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, the 
Pentagon, and aboard United Airlines flight 93, and the continuing and 
immediate threat of further attacks on the United States.
    Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency 
declared on September 14, 2001, last extended on September 5, 2006, and 
the powers and authorities adopted to deal with that emergency, must 
continue in effect beyond September 14, 2007. Therefore, I am continuing 
in effect for an additional year the national emergency I declared on 
September 14, 2001, with respect to the terrorist threat.
    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.
                                                George W. Bush
