Statement on the Situation in Russia

November 26, 2007

    I am deeply concerned about the detention of numerous human rights 
activists and political leaders who participated in peaceful rallies in 
Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, and Nazran this weekend. I am 
particularly troubled by the use of force by law enforcement authorities 
to stop these peaceful activities and to prevent some journalists and 
human rights activists from covering them.
    The freedoms of expression, assembly, and press, as well as due 
process, are fundamental to any democratic society. I am hopeful that 
the Government of Russia will honor its international obligations in 
these areas, investigate allegations of abuses, and free those who 
remain in detention.
