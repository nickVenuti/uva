Statement on the Death of
Jennifer Blackburn Dunn

September 6, 2007

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Jennifer Dunn. She 
was a good friend and compassionate leader. During her congressional 
career, Jennifer effectively promoted policies that enabled more people 
throughout our country to realize the American Dream. She was committed 
to reforming welfare, reducing taxes, and strengthening our health care 
system. She was a tireless advocate for free trade and worked to

eliminate the death tax, believing that leadership on these issues would 
foster growth and prosperity for small businesses and communities. As a 
member of the House Republican leadership, Jennifer used her position to 
help strengthen women's rights and protect children.
    After leaving Congress, Jennifer continued to be a strong advocate 
of commonsense conservative values.
    Jennifer was most proud of her family. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with Keith, Bryant, Reagan, and Angus.
