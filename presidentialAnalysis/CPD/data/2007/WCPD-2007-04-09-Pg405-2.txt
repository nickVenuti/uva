Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Notice of Intention To 
Enter Into a Free Trade Agreement With Korea

April 1, 2007

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)

    Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002, 
(Public Law 107-210; the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the 
Congress of my intention to enter into a free trade agreement with the 
Republic of Korea.
    The United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (the ``Agreement'') 
will generate export opportunities for U.S. farmers, ranchers, 
manufacturers, and service suppliers, promote economic growth and the 
creation of better paying jobs in the United States, and help American 
consumers save money while offering them greater choices. The Agreement 
will also further enhance the strong United States-Korea partnership, 
which has served as a force for stability and prosperity in Asia.
    Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at 
least 90 days in advance of signing the Agreement. My Administration 
looks forward to working with the

Congress in developing appropriate legislation to approve and implement 
this Agreement.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on April 2.
