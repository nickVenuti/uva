Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa 2007

December 21, 2007

    I send greetings to those observing Kwanzaa.

[[Page 1632]]

    Established in 1966, Kwanzaa is celebrated each year as an 
opportunity for African Americans to honor African traditions of family, 
community, and culture. During the seven days leading up to the New 
Year, millions of individuals reflect on the past and renew their 
commitment to the principles of Kwanzaa--unity, self determination, 
collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, 
creativity, and faith.
    As family and friends gather to celebrate Kwanzaa, our citizens are 
reminded of the many African Americans who have contributed their talent 
and strength to this great Nation. I commend those observing this 
holiday for taking pride in your rich heritage. May the coming year be 
filled with the blessings of health and happiness.
    Laura and I send our best wishes for a joyous Kwanzaa celebration.
                                                George W. Bush
