Statement on the Death of
Senator Craig L. Thomas

June 5, 2007

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Wyoming Senator 
Craig Thomas. During nearly 23 years of public service as a Senator, 
Congressman, and State legislator, Senator Thomas was a tireless and 
effective advocate for the people of his beloved home State. He was a 
man of character and integrity, known for his devotion to the values he 
shared with the people of Wyoming. He leaves a lasting legacy as a 
guardian of Wyoming's lands and resources and our country's national 
parks. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Senator Thomas's wife, Susan, 
his family, and friends.
