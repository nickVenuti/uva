Remarks Following a Visit With Wounded Troops at Walter Reed Army 
Medical Center

December 20, 2007

    Thank you all for joining me. I've just come down from a tour of a 
couple of the wards up there here at Walter Reed. First, I'm inspired by 
the quality of health care. Americans may wonder whether or not our 
troops are getting the best possible health care, and they are. They're 
not only getting great care from good docs and nurses; they're getting a 
lot of compassion and a lot of love up in the wards. And so I want to 
thank you all. General, thank you very much for taking the lead.
    This past month is the lowest number of patients being admitted here 
since '02, and that's good news. It's good news for families who worry 
about their loved ones in harm's way, and it's good news for the staff 
here who would like nothing more to be--to have nobody come in here. 
Every time I come to a facility like this, I count my blessings. And one 
of the great blessings is to be the President of a country that produces 
such brave men and women.
    And so as we head into the holiday seasons, I ask for the good 
Lord's blessings on those in harm's way and their families. And I want 
to thank you again, General, for your hospitality. I appreciate you 
having me. Thank you. Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 4:14 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Maj. Gen. Carla G. Hawley-Bowland, USA, commanding general, North 
Atlantic Regional Medical Command and Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
