Statement on the Death of
Luciano Pavarotti

September 6, 2007

    Luciano Pavarotti was one of the most accomplished and acclaimed 
opera singers of all time. From singing with his father in a small 
church choir near Modena, Italy, to performing in sold-out stadiums in 
America and all across the world, Pavarotti entertained audiences with 
his perfect pitch and charismatic interpretations. Both as a soloist and 
as part of the Three Tenors, he sold millions of records and won many 
prestigious awards.
    Pavarotti was also a great humanitarian, using his magnificent 
talent to rally tremendous levels of support for victims of tragedies 
around the globe. His international vocal competition in Philadelphia 
and his school in Modena have encouraged and inspired generations of 
young artists to pursue their dreams.
    Laura and I join Luciano Pavarotti's fans across the world in 
mourning his loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Pavarotti 
family.
