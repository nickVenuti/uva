Memorandum on the 2007 Combined Federal Campaign

July 26, 2007

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: 2007 Combined Federal Campaign

    Admiral Thad W. Allen, Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, has 
agreed to serve as the Honorary National Chairman of the 2007 Combined 
Federal Campaign. I ask you to enthusiastically support the CFC by 
personally chairing the campaign in your agency and by exhorting top 
agency officials around the country to do the same.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. Public servants not 
only contribute to the campaign but also assume leadership roles to 
ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help positively influence 
thousands of employees and will guarantee another successful campaign.
                                                George W. Bush
