Statement on the Death of
Lady Bird Johnson

July 11, 2007

    Laura and I mourn the passing of our good friend and a warm and 
gracious woman, Lady Bird Johnson. Those who were blessed to know her 
remember Mrs. Johnson's lively and charming personality, and our Nation 
will always remember her with affection. Mrs. Johnson became First Lady 
on a fateful day in November 1963 and was a steady, gentle presence for 
a mourning Nation in the days that followed.
    In the White House, Mrs. Johnson shared her love of the environment 
and nature with our entire country. The native wildflowers that bloom 
along roadsides today are part of her lasting legacy. She joined 
President Johnson in the struggle for civil rights, inspiring millions 
of Americans. Her commitment to early education gave many children a 
head start in life.
    President Johnson once called her a woman of ``ideals, principles, 
intelligence, and refinement.'' She remained so throughout their life 
together and in the many years given to her afterward. She was much-
loved in our home State of Texas, and the Bush family is fortunate to 
have known her.
    Lady Bird Johnson leaves behind her devoted daughters, Lynda and 
Luci, their fine families, and a nation that joins them in honoring a 
good life of kindness and service.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
