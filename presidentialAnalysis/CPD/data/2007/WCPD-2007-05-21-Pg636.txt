Statement on the Death of
Jerry L. Falwell, Sr.

May 15, 2007

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Jerry Falwell, a man 
who cherished faith, family, and freedom. As the founder of Thomas Road 
Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, Jerry lived a life of faith and 
called upon men and women of all backgrounds to believe in God and serve 
their communities. One of his lasting contributions was the 
establishment of Liberty University, where he taught young people to 
remain true to their convictions and rely upon God's word throughout 
each stage of their lives.
    Today our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Macel, and the 
rest of the Falwell family.
