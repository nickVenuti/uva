Remarks on Tornado Damage in Greensburg, Kansas

May 6, 2007

    Our hearts are heavy for the loss of life in Greensburg, Kansas. A 
tornado devastated that community. It just basically wiped it out.
    I spoke to the Governor and Senator Pat Roberts about the extent of 
the devastation. They said to me, ``It's hard to describe how bad this 
community was hit.''
    I have declared a major disaster for that community, and I hope that 
helps. It's going to take a long time for the community to recover. And 
so we will help in any way we can. There's a certain spirit in the 
Midwest of our country, a pioneer spirit that still exists, and I'm 
confident this community will be rebuilt. To the extent that we can 
help, we will. The most important thing now, though, is for our citizens 
to ask for the good Lord to comfort those who hurt.
    Thank you very much.
