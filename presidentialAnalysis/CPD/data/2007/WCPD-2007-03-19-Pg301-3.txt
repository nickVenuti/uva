Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Proposed Budget Cancellations

March 9, 2007

Dear Madam Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2007 request to 
cancel $3.1 billion of funding from lower-priority Federal programs and 
excess funds. This request would offset fully the funds needed to 
address the $3.1 billion FY 2007 funding shortfall for the Department of 
Defense to implement the

recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The 
proposed cancellations would affect the Departments of Agriculture, 
Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and 
Urban Development, the Interior, and Transportation, as well as the 
Corps of Engineers.
    The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
