Statement on the Deaths of Firefighters in Charleston, South Carolina

June 19, 2007

    Laura and I mourn the devastating loss of some of America's bravest. 
Our prayers are with the families and friends of nine firefighters from 
Charleston, South Carolina, who selflessly gave their own lives to 
protect their community. These firefighters were true heroes who 
demonstrated great skill and courage. Their unwavering commitment to 
their neighbors and to the city of Charleston is an inspiration to all 
Americans.
