Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders

May 2, 2007

    I thank the leaders from Congress for coming down to discuss the 
Iraq funding issue. Yesterday was a day that highlighted differences. 
Today is a day where we can work together to find common ground. I will 
inform the Speaker and the leader of our serious intent, and to that 
end, I am going to name our Chief of Staff, Josh Bolten, along with 
Steve Hadley and Rob Portman to work with members of both parties to 
fund our troops.
    I think it's very important we do this as quickly as we possibly 
can. I'm confident that we can reach agreement. I know that it's going 
to require good will, but we all care deeply about our country and care 
about this issue. And so I want to thank the Members for coming down 
again. I'm looking forward to our discussions. I'm looking forward to 
what will be constructive set of discussions and negotiations.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 2:46 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House.
