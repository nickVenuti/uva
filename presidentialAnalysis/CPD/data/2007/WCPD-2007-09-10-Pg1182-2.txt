Message on the Observance of Rosh Hashanah, 5768

September 6, 2007

    I send greetings to those around the world celebrating Rosh 
Hashanah.
    The sound of the Shofar heralds the beginning of a new year and a 
time of remembrance and renewal for the Jewish people. During these holy 
days, men and women are called to reflect on their faith and to honor 
the blessings of creation.
    The enduring traditions of Rosh Hashanah remind us of the deep 
values of faith and family that strengthen our Nation and help guide us 
each day. As Jewish people around the world come together to celebrate 
Rosh Hashanah, it is a chance to look to the new year with hope and 
faith.
    Laura and I send our best wishes for a blessed Rosh Hashanah and 
shanah tovah.
                                                George W. Bush
