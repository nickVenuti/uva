Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Certain Terrorist Attacks

September 12, 2007

To the Congress of the United States:

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent to the 
Federal Register the enclosed notice, stating that the emergency 
declared with respect to the terrorist attacks on the United States of 
September 11, 2001, is to continue in effect for an additional year.
    The terrorist threat that led to the declaration on September 14, 
2001, of a national emergency continues. For this reason, I have 
determined that it is necessary to continue in effect after September 
14, 2007, the national emergency with respect to the terrorist threat.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 September 12, 2007.
