Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Iran

November 8, 2007

To the Congress of the United States:

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency

[[Page 1482]]

is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with 
this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal Register 
for publication, stating that the Iran emergency declared in Executive 
Order 12170 on November 14, 1979, is to continue in effect beyond 
November 14, 2007.
    Our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the 
process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is 
still underway. For these reasons, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national emergency declared on November 14, 
1979, with respect to Iran, beyond November 14, 2007.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 November 8, 2007.
