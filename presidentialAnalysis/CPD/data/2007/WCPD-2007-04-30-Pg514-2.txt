Statement on the Identity Theft Task Force Report

April 23, 2007

    I commend Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Chairman of the 
Federal Trade Commission Deborah Majoras for their work on the Identity 
Theft Task Force report released today. The report is the culmination of 
many months of hard work by numerous Federal agencies. Identity theft is 
a serious problem in America, and my administration is working to combat 
this crime and to assist its victims. I thank the Attorney General, the 
Chairman, and their staffs for taking on this difficult and important 
assignment.
