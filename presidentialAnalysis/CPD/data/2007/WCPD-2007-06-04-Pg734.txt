Statement on the Resignation of Daniel J. Bartlett as Counselor to the 
President

June 1, 2007

    Laura and I will miss Dan Bartlett very much. Dan has been a true 
counselor to the President. His contribution has been immeasurable. I 
value his judgment, and I treasure his friendship. Since coming to work 
for me 14 years ago as I prepared to run for Governor, Dan has become a 
husband and a father. I understand his decision to make his young family 
his first priority. His most important job is to be a loving husband and 
father of three young sons. We wish him all the best.
