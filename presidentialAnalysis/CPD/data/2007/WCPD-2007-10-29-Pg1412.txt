Remarks on Departure for a Tour of Southern California Areas Damaged by 
Wildfires

October 25, 2007

    Good morning. I'm on my way out to California. I'm looking forward 
to seeing Governor Schwarzenegger, to thank him for all the good work 
that the State and local authorities are doing to help the good people 
of southern California battle these wildfires. I will assure the people 
of California that the Federal Government will be deploying resources, 
assets, and manpower necessary to help fight these fires. As well, I 
will assure them that there's a--because of the declaration I signed 
yesterday, there will be help for the people of California. Evidently, 
the winds are more favorable today, which should be encouraging to the 
firefighters.
    I'm also looking forward to spending some time with some of the 
firefighters. We've got some incredibly brave citizens who are risking 
their lives to protect people and property in California, and we owe a 
great debt of gratitude to our Nation's firefighters.
    It's a sad situation out there in southern California. I fully 
understand that the people have got a lot of anguish in their hearts, 
and they just need to know a lot of folks care about them. And I'm 
looking forward to my trip out there.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 7:31 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House.
