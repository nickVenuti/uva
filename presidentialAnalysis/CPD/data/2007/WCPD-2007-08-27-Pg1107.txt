August 22, 2007

    How is everybody doing? Thank you for joining me. I'm visiting with 
some of the area's finest citizens. We talked about businesses and 
opportunities and sports and culture. It's good to be with you. Thank 
you. I hope you leave here with the sense that I'm upbeat about the 
future of this country. I believe strongly we can do anything we put our 
minds to do.
    Thank you all for coming.
