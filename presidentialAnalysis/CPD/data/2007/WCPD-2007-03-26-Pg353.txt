Statement on the Death of
Ray Nasher

March 19, 2007

    Ray Nasher was a brilliant businessman, diplomat, and 
philanthropist. Through his service at the United Nations, he 
represented the best of his country and his home State of Texas. Through 
his patronage of the arts, he shared his magnificent collection of 
modern and contemporary sculpture in countless office spaces and the 
world-class museums he created in Dallas and at Duke University. Ray 
served the last three Presidents as a member of the President's 
Committee on the Arts and Humanities and served his country by giving 
all Americans greater access to the arts. Laura and I send our deepest 
condolences to Ray Nasher's family and friends.
