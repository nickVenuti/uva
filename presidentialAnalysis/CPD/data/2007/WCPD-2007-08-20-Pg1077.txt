Notice--Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations

August 15, 2007

    On August 17, 2001, consistent with the authority provided to me 
under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 170l et 
seq.), I issued Executive Order 13222. In that order, I declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 
1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.). Because the Export 
Administration Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national 
emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond 
August 17, 2007. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222.
    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 August 15, 2007.
