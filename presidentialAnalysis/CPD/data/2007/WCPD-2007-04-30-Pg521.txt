Statement on the Interagency Task Force on Returning Global War on 
Terror Heroes

April 24, 2007

    The brave men and women who have volunteered to protect and defend 
our country deserve to receive the highest level of support from our 
grateful Nation. Today Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson and 
members of the Interagency Task Force on Returning Global War on Terror 
Heroes released a government-wide action plan that sets out steps to 
improve our care for America's troops and veterans.
    The task force has proposed specific recommendations to immediately 
begin addressing the problems and gaps in services that were identified 
across the veterans and military healthcare systems. These 
recommendations include directing the Department of Defense and the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to develop a joint process for disability 
determination. Additionally, I have asked Secretary Nicholson to 
communicate directly with the members of the Commission on Care for 
America's Returning Wounded Warriors to ensure that both groups exchange 
ideas and information that will efficiently advance reform efforts.
    I commend the work of the task force, welcome its recommendations, 
and have directed Secretary Nicholson to work with all agencies involved 
on the recommendations

and to report back to me within 45 days on how these measures are being 
implemented.
