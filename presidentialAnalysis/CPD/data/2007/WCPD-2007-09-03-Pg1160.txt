Message on the Observance of Labor Day

August 31, 2007

    I send greetings to those celebrating Labor Day 2007.
    Our country's economy is built on the hard work and ingenuity of the 
American people. There is no limit to what our citizens can accomplish 
when they have the skills to compete and the freedom to achieve their 
dreams. Through vision and determination, American workers are 
transforming their neighborhoods, strengthening our economy, and 
realizing the great promise of our Nation.
    Today, productivity is high, consumers are confident, and incomes 
are rising across our country. Our economy has experienced one of the 
fastest growth rates of any major industrialized nation. More than 8.3 
million jobs have been created in America since August 2003, and the 
unemployment rate remains low. My Administration is committed to 
promoting pro-growth economic policies, keeping taxes low, and 
supporting small businesses to keep our economy strong and growing.
    On Labor Day, we honor the hard work and dedication of the men and 
women of our workforce. Their efforts contribute to the prosperity of 
our great Nation.
    Laura and I send our best wishes.
                                                George W. Bush
