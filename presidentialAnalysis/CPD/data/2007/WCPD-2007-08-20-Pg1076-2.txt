Statement on the Death of Mervyn E. Griffin, Jr.

August 13, 2007

    For over half a century, Merv Griffin entertained America. He was a 
man of innovation and energy who greeted challenges with laughter and 
determination. By following his passions and trusting his instincts, 
Merv became one of our Nation's best-known and most respected 
entertainers. He introduced Americans to a generation of talent on his 
talk show, created two of the most successful game shows in history, and 
led a thriving hospitality business. Merv was also a generous leader who 
gave back to his community, donating millions of dollars to provide 
abused children with safe haven and brighter futures.
    Laura and I are saddened by his death. His family is in our thoughts 
and prayers.
