Message Sending Holiday Greetings to Members of the Armed Forces

December 21, 2007

To the Men and Women of the United States Armed Forces

    On behalf of a grateful Nation, Laura and I send our best wishes for 
the holidays.
    In this season of giving, we remember our duty to others, and we see 
that sense of duty fulfilled in the men and women who wear our Nation's 
uniform. Our country owes you a debt of gratitude for your courage and 
resolve to serve the cause of peace. Americans are proud of your 
dedicated service, and I am proud to be the Commander in Chief of the 
greatest force for freedom in the history of the world.
    Our Nation is thankful for the many sacrifices you and your families 
make every day. During the holidays and throughout the coming year, we 
ask the Almighty to bestow His protection and care on you and your loved 
ones. We pray for your safety and for liberty, justice, and peace on 
Earth.
    Laura and I wish you a joyful holiday season. May God bless you, and 
may God continue to bless America.
                                                George W. Bush
