Remarks Following a Tour of Labradores Mayas in Iximche, Guatemala

March 12, 2007

[The President's remarks are joined in progress.]

    ----Mrs. Bush and I have been looking forward to meeting you, 
because you represent people who dream, people who work hard, and people 
who make wonderful products.
    And there's two things I want to share. One, that USAID, which is 
funded through the generosity of the American people, is helping people 
like you all throughout the region to realize your dreams, because we 
believe in the dignity of every person. We want people to realize their 
God-given potential. You have proven that if given a chance, you and 
hundreds of others can succeed, and that's what we want.
    Secondly, free trade is important for a lot of people. It's 
important for our country, it's a gateway. It creates jobs in America 
just like it creates jobs here.
    And so we thank you for your wonderful hospitality. We loved being 
with your families. Gracias. Que Dios les bendiga.
