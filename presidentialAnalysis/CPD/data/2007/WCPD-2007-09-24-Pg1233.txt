Message on the Observance of Yom Kippur, 5768

September 20, 2007

    For it is a Day of Atonement, on which expiation is made on your 
behalf before the LORD your God.
                                               Leviticus 23:28
    On Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, the faithful 
leave behind their daily concerns and gather together to draw near to 
God. This day is a time when Jews everywhere reflect on their lives, 
seek forgiveness, and find solace in God's merciful nature.
    The Shofar's call signals our recommitment to our Creator and to 
each other. In the year ahead, may we all be reminded of the Almighty's 
steadfast love for His children and achieve the peace we all seek.
    Laura and I send our best wishes for a blessed Yom Kippur.
                                                George W. Bush
