Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Small-Business Owners in
Fushe-Kruje, Albania

June 10, 2007

    One of the exciting moments for our trip to Albania is to meet with 
small-business owners. Laura and I thank the mayor. We thank the owner 
of the restaurant, and we thank these entrepreneurs for joining us to 
talk about your story, about your dreams, and about the opportunities a 
microloan program, provided by the taxpayers of the United States, is 
giving you to create jobs.
    And so we're excited to be here. Thank you for coming. And we're 
looking forward to hearing your stories.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 3:50 p.m. at Cafe Cela. In his remarks, he 
referred to Mayor Ismet Mavriqi of Fushe-Kruje, Albania. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of these remarks.
