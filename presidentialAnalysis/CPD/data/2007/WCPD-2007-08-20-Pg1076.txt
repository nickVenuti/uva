Remarks on the Resignation of Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Adviser 
Karl Rove

August 13, 2007

    Karl Rove is moving on down the road. I've been talking to Karl for 
a while about his desire to spend more time with Darby and Andrew. This 
is a family that has made enormous sacrifices, not only for our beloved 
State of Texas but for a country we both love.
    Now, we've been friends for a long time, and we're still going to be 
friends. I would call Karl Rove a dear friend. We've known each other as 
youngsters interested in serving our State. We worked together so we 
could be in a position to serve this country. And so I thank my friend. 
I'll be on the road behind you here in a little bit. I thank Darby and I 
thank Karl for making a tremendous sacrifice, and I wish you all the 
very best.

Note: The President spoke at 11:31 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Karl Rove's wife, Darby Rove, and 
son, Andrew Rove. The transcript released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary also included the remarks of Deputy Chief of Staff Rove.
