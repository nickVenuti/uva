Statement on Representative Deborah D. Pryce's Decision Not To Seek 
Reelection

August 16, 2007

    Throughout her congressional career, Deborah Pryce has championed 
issues that matter to the families of central Ohio. Her commitment to 
reducing taxes, strengthening our national defense, and reforming our 
health care system has helped improve the lives of her constituents and 
made America a more hopeful nation. She has also earned national 
recognition as a persuasive advocate on behalf of women and children. 
Based on her strong legislative record and consensus-building skills, 
Deb's colleagues selected her to lead the House Republican Conference--
the highest leadership post ever held by a Republican woman. She will be 
missed when she departs the Congress.
    I look forward to continuing to work with her throughout the 
remainder of her service. Laura and I appreciate Deb's friendship and 
wish her and her family all the best.
