Statement on the Death of
King Mohammad Zahir Shah of Afghanistan

July 23, 2007

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Mohammad Zahir Shah, who 
was King of Afghanistan from 1933 to 1973.
    Zahir Shah was a monumental figure in Afghan history, and his life 
spanned vast changes in that country's political system. He returned to 
Afghanistan as an ordinary citizen in 2002, shortly after the Taliban 
regime was removed from power, and continued to play an important part 
in the life of his country. Zahir Shah supported the goal of a 
representative and freely elected government in his homeland, and he 
encouraged Afghanistan toward democracy and stability. His presence in 
Afghanistan as a private citizen and ``Father of the Nation'' for the 
past several years has been an important factor in rebuilding 
Afghanistan.
    On behalf of the American people, Laura and I extend our condolences 
to Mohammad Zahir Shah's family and to the people of Afghanistan.
