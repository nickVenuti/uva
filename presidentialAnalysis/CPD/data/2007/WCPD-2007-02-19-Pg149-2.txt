Statement on the Death of
Charlie Norwood

February 13, 2007

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Congressman Charlie 
Norwood. Charlie was a good friend and a strong, spirited legislator who 
always stuck to his principles, remembering that his duty was to 
represent the best interests of the citizens of his district. Throughout 
his seven terms in Congress, he was a strong advocate for patients' 
rights, high-quality education, and protecting the homeland. As a 
lawmaker, he had the ability to deliver on his promises. I enjoyed 
working with him and valued our close friendship.
    After becoming ill, Charlie demonstrated his extraordinary strength 
by continuing to serve our Nation with the same dedication. He was a 
good man and a true patriot.
    Laura and I send our prayers to Charlie's wife, Gloria, and his 
children and grandchildren.
