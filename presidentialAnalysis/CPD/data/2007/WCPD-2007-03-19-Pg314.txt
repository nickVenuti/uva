    The President and I had a long discussion this morning about issues 
that will help create jobs and facilitate the flow of trade, for 
example, all aiming at helping the people in our respective countries 
realize God-given potential. And so we come bringing the greetings of 
the people of the United States. Our Ambassador has briefed me on some 
of the programs that the taxpayers of my country have helped fund. But 
we're really interested in hearing your stories. And Colombia is a fine 
democracy. And the true test of a democracy is for every citizen in that 
country to be able to feel the full promise of society.
    And so we thank you for coming. And, Mr. President, why don't we--we 
can go around the table, and I'm interested in hearing the different 
stories about the lives of some of your citizens.
    Shall we start? How about you, doctor? Do you want to start?

Note: The President spoke at 4:28 p.m. at Casa de Narino. In his 
remarks, he referred to President Alvaro Uribe Velez of Colombia; and 
U.S. Ambassador to Colombia William B. Wood.
