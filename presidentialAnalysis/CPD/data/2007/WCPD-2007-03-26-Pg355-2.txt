Message to the Congress on Trade With Haiti

March 19, 2007

To the Congress of the United States:

    The Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership 
Encouragement Act of 2006 (Division D, Title V of Public Law 109-432), 
amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (Title II of the Trade 
and Development Act of 2000, Public Law 106-200)(CBERA), to make certain 
products from Haiti eligible for preferential tariff treatment. In 
accordance with section 213A of CBERA, as amended, I have determined 
that Haiti meets the eligibility requirements under section 213A(d)(1) 
of CBERA, as amended, and that Haiti is meeting the conditions regarding 
enforcement of circumvention under section 213A(e)(1) of CBERA, as 
amended.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 March 19, 2007.
