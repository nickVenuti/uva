Statement on Assistance to Israel

June 19, 2007

    I am strongly committed to Israel's security and viability as a 
Jewish state and to the maintenance of its qualitative military edge. 
During our meeting today, I told Prime Minister Olmert that I am 
committed to reaching a new 10-year agreement that will give Israel the 
increased assistance it requires to meet the new threats and challenges 
it faces. The work on this new agreement was launched during the Prime 
Minister's previous visit. I will send Under Secretary of State Nick 
Burns and an interagency team to Israel in July to lead discussions 
aimed at concluding an agreement soon.

Note: In his statement, the President referred to Prime Minister Ehud 
Olmert of Israel.
