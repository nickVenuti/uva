Remarks on Presenting the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor

December 12, 2007

    You know, one of the wonderful experiences of being a President is 
to welcome citizens who have served their communities with valor and 
compassion. And I--General and I are surrounded by four such gentlemen 
who have been heroic in their duties. They will tell you they were just 
doing their job; I'm telling you they did their job with extraordinary 
courage. And so it's been an honor to award them this precious medal. 
And I want to thank you all very much for joining us. Proud to call you 
fellow citizens.

Note: The President spoke at 2:11 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Attorney General Michael B. 
Mukasey.
