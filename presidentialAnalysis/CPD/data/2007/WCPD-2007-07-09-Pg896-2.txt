United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement. This agreement will generate

service suppliers, promote economic growth and the creation of better 
paying jobs in the United States, and help American consumers save money 
while offering them greater choices. The agreement will also further

landmark agreement, to the considerable benefit of the American people.
