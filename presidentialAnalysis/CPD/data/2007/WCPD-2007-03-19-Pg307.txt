Remarks at a Luncheon Hosted By President Alvaro Uribe Velez of Colombia 
in Bogota, Colombia

March 11, 2007

    Mr. President, thank you very much. I appreciate your hospitality. I 
am amazed by the beauty of your country. I've never been here to the 
beautiful capital city of your country, but Laura and I were struck by 
two things: the beauty of the landscape and the warmness of the people.
    We bring greetings from the United States to the people of your 
country. We have been friends, and we shall remain friends. We value 
your democracy. I appreciate your strong leadership. We come during a 
period where your country has come through very difficult times, and now 
there's a brighter day

ahead. And my message to the people of your country is, we want to help 
every individual realize their God-given potential.
    I'd like to propose a toast to the people of this country, to the 
leadership of this country. May God bless you.
