Message on the Observance of Hanukkah 2007

December 3, 2007

    I send greetings to all those celebrating Hanukkah, the festival of 
lights.
    Hanukkah commemorates a victory for freedom and the courage and 
faith that made it possible. More than 2,000 years ago, the land of 
ancient Israel was conquered, its sacred Temple was desecrated, and the 
Jewish people were forbidden to practice their faith. A patriot named 
Judah Maccabee and his followers rose up against their oppressors to 
take back Jerusalem. When the Maccabees returned to reclaim and purify 
their Holy Temple, the oil used for dedication should have lasted only 
one day but burned for eight. Every year since then, Jews have 
celebrated this victory of light over darkness and given thanks for the 
presence of a just and loving God.
    As Jewish Americans prepare to light the Hanukkah candles, we are 
reminded of the many blessings in our lives. The candles' glow has the 
power to lift our souls, put hope in our hearts, and make our Nation a 
more compassionate and peaceful place. We pray that those who still live 
in the darkness of

tyranny will someday see the light of freedom, and we ask for God's 
continued guidance and boundless love and His protection of all those in 
need during this holiday season.
    Laura and I wish all people of the Jewish faith a Happy Hanukkah.
                                                George W. Bush
