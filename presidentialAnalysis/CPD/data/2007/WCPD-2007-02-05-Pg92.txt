Statement on the Death of Deborah Orin-Eilbeck

January 28, 2007

    Laura and I were saddened to learn of the death of Deborah Orin-
Eilbeck. Deb had a distinguished, decades-long career as a journalist, 
covering every Presidential campaign since 1980 and joining the New York 
Post's Washington bureau in 1988. Deb fought a valiant battle against 
cancer with the same tenacity, devotion, and determination that she 
brought to her work in the White House briefing room through numerous 
administrations.
    Laura and I send our condolences to Deb's husband, Neville Eilbeck, 
and to her family, friends, and colleagues. She will be missed by all of 
us at the White House who cared deeply for her.
