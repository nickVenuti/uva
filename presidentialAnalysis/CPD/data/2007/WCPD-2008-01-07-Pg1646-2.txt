Statement on Signing the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007

December 31, 2007

    Today, I have signed into law S. 2271, the ``Sudan Accountability 
and Divestment Act of 2007.'' I share the deep concern of the Congress 
over the continued violence in Darfur perpetrated by the Government of 
Sudan and rebel groups. My Administration will continue its efforts to 
bring about significant improvements in the conditions in Sudan through 
sanctions against the Government of Sudan and high-level diplomatic 
engagement and by supporting the deployment of peacekeepers in Darfur.
    This Act purports to authorize State and local governments to divest 
from companies doing business in named sectors in Sudan and thus risks 
being interpreted as insulating from Federal oversight State and local 
divestment actions that could interfere with implementation of national 
foreign policy. However, as the Constitution vests the exclusive 
authority to conduct foreign relations with the Federal Government, the 
executive branch shall construe and enforce this legislation in a manner 
that does not conflict with that authority.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 December 31, 2007.

Note: S. 2271, approved December 31, was assigned Public Law No. 110-
174.
