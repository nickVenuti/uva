Easter

    The President. Laura and I just had the honor of celebrating Easter 
Sunday with members of our Armed Forces. I had a chance to reflect on 
the great sacrifice that our military and their families are making. I 
prayed for their safety; I prayed for their strength and comfort; and I 
prayed for peace.
    This is a joyous day for many people around the world, and it's a 
day for us to reflect on the many blessings in our lives. And we thank 
the General and the troops at Fort Hood for welcoming me and Laura, and 
Mother and Dad, and my mother-in-law. We wish all Americans a peaceful 
weekend, and we wish our troops all the very best.
    Thank you.
    The First Lady. Happy Easter.

Note: The President spoke at 10 a.m. at the 13th Sustainment Command 
Chapel.
