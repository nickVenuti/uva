Message on the Observance of Cuban Independence Day, 2007

May 18, 2007

    I send greetings to all those celebrating the 105th anniversary of 
Cuba's Independence.
    The longing for justice, freedom, and human rights is a desire that 
can be delayed but never denied. The United States remains committed to 
extending the full blessings of liberty around the world, and on this 
important milestone, we stand united with 
freedom-loving people of all nations in the conviction that Cuba's 
future must be one of dignity, liberty, and opportunity.
    This day is also an opportunity to recognize the generations of 
Cuban Americans who have made contributions to our society. Your hard 
work and high ideals reflect the best of America and enrich our Nation.
    Laura and I send our best wishes. May God bless the people of Cuba 
and all the sons and daughters of Cuba who call America home.
                                                George W. Bush
