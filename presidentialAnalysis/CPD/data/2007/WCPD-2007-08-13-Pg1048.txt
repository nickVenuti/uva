Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Intelligence Reform 
Legislation

August 4, 2007

    Tonight the House joined the Senate in passing legislation that will 
close a critical gap in our intelligence collection, and I appreciate 
their efforts to complete the legislation before the August recess. The 
Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, has assured me that 
this bill gives him what he needs to continue to protect the country, 
and therefore, I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my 
desk.
    I also want to remind Congress that our work on reforming the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is not complete. When Congress 
returns in September, we need to work together on additional reforms, 
including the important issue of providing meaningful liability 
protection to those who are alleged to have assisted our Nation 
following the attacks of September 11, 2001.

Note: The statement referred to S. 1927.
