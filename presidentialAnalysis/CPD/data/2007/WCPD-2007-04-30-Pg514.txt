Statement on the Death of
Boris Yeltsin

April 23, 2007

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of former Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. President Yeltsin was an historic figure who 
served his country during a time of momentous change. He played a key 
role as the Soviet Union dissolved, helped lay the foundations of 
freedom in Russia, and became the first democratically elected leader in 
that country's history. I appreciate the efforts that President Yeltsin 
made to build a strong relationship between Russia and the United 
States. We offer our sincerest condolences to the Yeltsin family and to 
the Russian people.
