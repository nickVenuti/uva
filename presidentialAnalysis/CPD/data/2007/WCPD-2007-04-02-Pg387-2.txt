Remarks Following a Meeting With the House Republican Conference

March 29, 2007

    I want to thank the Republican leadership and the Republican Members 
of Congress for coming down to have a very frank and open discussion 
about issues facing our country. Yesterday I gave a speech, making it 
clear that I'll veto a bill that restricts our commanders on the ground 
in Iraq, a bill that doesn't fund our troops, a bill that's got too much 
spending on it. I made that clear to the Members.
    We stand united in saying loud and clear that when we've got a troop 
in harm's way, we expect that troop to be fully funded; and we've got 
commanders making tough decisions on the ground, we expect there to be 
no strings on our commanders; and that we expect the Congress to be wise 
about how they spend the people's money.
    We spent time talking today about our strong belief that we've got 
to keep taxes low. And so we had a very productive session, a session of 
friends talking amongst friends, all aiming to put a strategy together 
of how we can work together to secure this Nation and keep it 
prosperous. And so I appreciate you all coming. You're welcome back at 
the White House any time you want to join us.
    Thank you very much. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:28 a.m. on the North Portico at the 
White House. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish 
language transcript of these remarks.
