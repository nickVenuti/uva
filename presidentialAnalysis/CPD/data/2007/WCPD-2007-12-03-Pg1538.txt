Remarks Following Meetings With Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel and 
President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority

November 28, 2007

    Mr. Prime Minister, thank you; Mr. President--a series of successful 
meetings today with these leaders. Yesterday was an important day, and 
it was a hopeful beginning. No matter how important yesterday was, it's 
not nearly as important as tomorrow and the days beyond.
    I appreciate the commitment of these leaders to working hard to 
achieve peace. I wouldn't be standing here if I didn't believe that 
peace was possible, and they wouldn't be here either if they didn't 
think peace was possible.
    It's very important for the international community to support these 
two leaders during the bilateral negotiations that will take place. And 
one thing I've assured both gentlemen is that the United States will be 
actively engaged in the process; that we will use our power to help you 
as you come up with the necessary decisions to lay out a Palestinian 
state that will live side by side in peace with Israel.
    And so I wish you all the best. I appreciate your courage and 
leadership. It's an honor to call you friends. And it's an honor to have 
watched you yesterday as you laid out your respective visions for 
something we all want, which is peace in the Holy Land.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 2:04 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House.
