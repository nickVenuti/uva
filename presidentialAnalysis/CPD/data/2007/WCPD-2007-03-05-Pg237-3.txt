March 1 Tornadoes in Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri

    Yesterday afternoon I spoke to Governor Riley of Alabama, this 
morning I spoke to Governor Perdue of Georgia, expressing my personal 
condolences as well as the condolences of the Nation for those who lost 
their lives in the recent tragedies in those two States.
    Tomorrow I'm going down to Georgia and Alabama. I go down with a 
heavy heart. I go down knowing full well that I'll be seeing people 
whose lives were turned upside down by the tornadoes. I'll do my very 
best to comfort them. I ask our Nation, for those who are prayerful, to 
give a prayer for the victims

of the storms, and ask for the blessings that can come upon people and 
the comfort necessary to deal with the recent tragedy. Thank you all 
very much.

House.
