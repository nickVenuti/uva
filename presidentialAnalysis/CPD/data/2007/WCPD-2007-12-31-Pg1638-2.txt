Remarks on the Death of Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan 
in Crawford, Texas

December 27, 2007

    Laura and I extend our deepest condolences to the family of Benazir 
Bhutto, to her friends, and to her supporters. We send our condolences 
to the families of the others who were killed in today's violence. And 
we send our condolences to all the people of Pakistan on this tragic 
occasion.
    The United States strongly condemns this cowardly act by murderous 
extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan's democracy. Those who 
committed this crime must be brought to justice. Mrs. Bhutto served her 
nation twice as Prime Minister, and she knew that her return to Pakistan 
earlier this year put her life at risk. Yet she refused to allow 
assassins to dictate the course of her country.
    We stand with the people of Pakistan in their struggle against the 
forces of terror and extremism. We urge them to honor Benazir Bhutto's 
memory by continuing with the democratic process for which she so 
bravely gave her life.

Note: The President spoke at 9:55 a.m. at the Bush Ranch.
