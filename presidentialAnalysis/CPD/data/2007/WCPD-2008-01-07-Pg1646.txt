Statement on the Appointment of Representative Roger F. Wicker as United 
States Senator for Mississippi

December 31, 2007

    Today Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour announced the appointment 
of Representative Roger Wicker to serve as United States Senator for the 
State of Mississippi, succeeding Senator Trent Lott.
    I welcome Representative Wicker's appointment and commend Governor 
Barbour for the selection. Representative Wicker's leadership has earned 
the respect of his constituents and his colleagues in the House of 
Representatives. He is an advocate for our men and women in uniform and 
a champion of modernizing our health care system, and he shares Senator 
Lott's commitment to promote the interests of the people of Mississippi.
    I look forward to working with Roger in his new role representing 
Mississippi in the United States Senate.
