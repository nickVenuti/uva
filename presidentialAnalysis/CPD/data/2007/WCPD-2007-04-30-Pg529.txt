Statement on the Death of 
Jack J. Valenti

April 26, 2007

    Laura and I are saddened by Jack Valenti's death. Jack Valenti was a 
great American and a great Texan. He bravely flew combat missions during 
World War II and ably served in the White House. From protecting 
families by creating the movie rating system to advocating for 
intellectual property rights, Jack Valenti helped transform the motion 
picture industry. He leaves a powerful legacy in Washington, in 
Hollywood, and across our Nation.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with Jack's wife, Mary Margaret, his 
children, and his friends and colleagues.
