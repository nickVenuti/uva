Statement on Congressional Action on Fiscal Year 2007 Appropriations 
Legislation

February 15, 2007

    I am pleased that the final bill for the Fiscal Year 2007 
appropriations process complies with the overall spending limits that I 
set. That means for the third year in a row, domestic discretionary 
spending will be below inflation. However, I remain concerned that the 
bill, in many cases, reflects the wrong spending priorities. In 
particular, the bill shifts funding needed for our Armed Forces to 
unrequested domestic programs. The Congress should work to address these 
priorities without adding to the deficit.
    I am pleased this legislation makes progress on earmarks, but there 
is more to do. As the Congress takes up the 2008 budget, it should 
continue to take steps to improve transparency for all earmarks, provide 
the option of an up-or-down vote for each earmark, and reduce the number 
and cost of earmarks by at least half.
