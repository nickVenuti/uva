Statement on the Death of Representative Julia M. Carson

December 15, 2007

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Representative Julia 
Carson. Throughout her decade of service in the U.S. House of 
Representatives and her nearly 20 years in the Indiana General Assembly, 
Representative Carson served her constituents in Indianapolis with 
passion and commitment. She was revered as a champion for building 
strong and safe communities, working to end homelessness, improving 
financial literacy for all Americans, and helping her constituents 
achieve and maintain the dream of home ownership.
    Julia was a dedicated and admired public servant who will be missed 
by her many friends and colleagues both at home in Indiana and in our 
Nation's Capital. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and 
friends.
