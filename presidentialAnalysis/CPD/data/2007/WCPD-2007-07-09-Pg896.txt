Statement on Modifications to the Visa Waiver Program

June 30, 2007

    Last November, I announced my intention to seek modifications to our 
Visa Waiver Program that would offer our closest partners in Central and 
Eastern Europe as well as others, such as the Republic of Korea, an 
accelerated process for admission to the program as we strengthen the 
program's security components. I am committed to continuing to work with 
Congress to produce legislation that would strengthen our country's 
security by implementing this initiative. It is in our Nation's interest 
to facilitate travel to the United States and, at the same time, to 
prevent terrorists from being able to exploit that travel.
