African Union Mission to the United States

September 12, 2007

    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including section 7(a)(2) of 
the Department of State Authorities Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-472), I 
hereby extend to the African Union Mission to the United States of 
America, and to its members, the privileges and immunities enjoyed by 
diplomatic missions accredited to the United States, and by members of 
such missions, subject to corresponding conditions and obligations.
    This extension of privileges and immunities is not intended to 
abridge in any respect privileges and immunities that the African Union 
Mission to the United States of America and its members otherwise may 
have acquired or may acquire by law.
