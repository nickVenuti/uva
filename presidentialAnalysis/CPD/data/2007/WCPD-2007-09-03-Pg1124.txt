Statement on the Death of Police Officer Germaine Casey

August 27, 2007

    Officer Germaine Casey of the Rio Rancho Police Department died 
today from injuries suffered while serving as a member of my security 
detail in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am deeply saddened by his death and 
extraordinarily grateful for his protection. It is a high calling to 
choose to serve and protect your fellow citizens, and I will always be 
indebted to Officer Casey's service.
    He leaves behind his wife, Lisa, and their two children. They are in 
my thoughts and prayers. May God comfort the Casey family and his fellow 
law enforcement officials.
