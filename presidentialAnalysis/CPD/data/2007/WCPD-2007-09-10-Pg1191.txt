Statement on the Death of
D. James Kennedy

September 7, 2007

    Dr. D. James Kennedy was a man of great vision, faith, and 
integrity. Under his leadership, Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church of 
Florida developed from a small group of worshipers in an elementary 
school cafeteria into one of America's most prominent congregations. Dr. 
Kennedy's message of love and hope inspired millions of Americans and 
others worldwide through the institutions he founded, including Coral 
Ridge Ministries, Knox Theological Seminary, and Westminster Academy. He 
was also a student of history and successful author who encouraged 
Americans of faith to exercise their democratic freedoms and put their 
values into practice. His legacy of grace and personal humility will 
continue to influence hearts and lives.
    Laura and I pray for Anne, his wife of over 50 years, and the rest 
of the Kennedy family.
