Statement on the Death of
William C. France, Jr.

June 5, 2007

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Bill France, Jr. 
Bill was a legend in the world of NASCAR whose passion and vision for 
stock car racing led the sport to the national prominence it enjoys 
today.
    Bill brought racing's excitement to millions of new fans through his 
steadfast and innovative leadership. Bill also helped ensure that the 
NASCAR community found many ways to support the men and women of the 
U.S. Armed Forces. Our thoughts and prayers are with the France family.
