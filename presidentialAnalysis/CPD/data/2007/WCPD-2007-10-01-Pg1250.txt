Remarks Prior to a Meeting on Democracy in New York City

September 25, 2007

    Thank you all for coming. This is a meeting of people who love 
liberty and who understand that freedom is universal. I appreciate the 
ability to share thoughts about how to embolden those who seek reform to 
stand with those who are willing to fight tyranny, and ways for us all 
to be effective.
    As you know, there are people around the world who are desperate to 
live in free societies. I think, for example, of those in Burma. And 
it's incumbent upon those of us who live in free societies to help them. 
I can think of no better way to work toward freedom than to strategize 
with leaders from around the world who are willing to take the hard 
steps necessary to spread liberty.
    And so I'm looking forward to our strategy session. I appreciate 
your time. I want to thank you very much for your interest in this vital 
subject. Thanks.

Note: The President spoke at 1:34 p.m. at the United Nations 
Headquarters.
