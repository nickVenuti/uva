Remarks Following a Lunch Meeting With Business and Community Leaders in 
New Albany, Indiana

November 13, 2007

    Listen, I want to thank you all for joining me. Somebody told me Sam 
serves good food, and they're right. And it's good to be here in 
southern Indiana.
    I was sitting with business leaders, civic leaders, community 
activists. I was listening to the concerns of the folks down here. I 
appreciate the spirit of entrepreneurship that exists. I'm glad people 
are working. I understand we got to deal with some of the issues, like 
high gasoline prices.

    And it's been a real honor for me to visit with you. It's also good 
to be with an old family friend, Fuzzy Zoeller, who's been a friend of 
my family's for a long time. And I forgot that Fuzzy was from these 
parts and was so thrilled to see him when I walked in here.
    Thank you all for your time. Appreciate your consideration, and I 
love visiting with you. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 12:20 p.m. at Sam's Tavern. In his remarks, 
he referred to Sam Anderson, owner, Sam's Tavern; and professional 
golfer Frank U. ``Fuzzy'' Zoeller, Jr.
