Letter to the Members of the Federal Election Commission on Campaign 
Finance Reform

February 5, 1998

To the Members of the Federal Election Commission:

    I strongly support action to end the soft money raised by both 
political parties. That is why last year I asked the Federal Election 
Commission to ban soft money, under its current legal authority. I am 
very pleased that your General Counsel has proposed a new rule 
prohibiting national parties from raising soft money. Banning soft money 
fundraising by national party committees will enable our election laws 
to catch up with the reality of the way elections are financed today, 
and along with new campaign finance reform legislation, will take 
significant strides toward restoring public confidence in the campaign 
finance process.

    Now I ask you to step up to your responsibility and act, within your 
legal authority, to end the soft money system. The American people 
deserve nothing less.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton
