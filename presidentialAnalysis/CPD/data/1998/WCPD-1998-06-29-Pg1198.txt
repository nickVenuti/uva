Statement on Congressional Action on Internal Revenue Service Reform 
Legislation

June 23, 1998

    For months now, I have urged Congress to do more to help the 
American taxpayer. Today I am pleased that the House and Senate have 
finally reached a bipartisan agreement to reform the IRS and strengthen 
taxpayer rights. We need an IRS that reflects American values and 
respects American taxpayers. This bill goes a long way toward that goal, 
and I look forward to signing it into law.
