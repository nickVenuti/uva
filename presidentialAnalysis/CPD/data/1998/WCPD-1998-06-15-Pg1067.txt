Statement on the Resignation of Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton

June 8, 1998

    It is with a deep sense of gratitude that I accept the resignation 
today of John Dalton as Secretary of the Navy. Whether as a young 
midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, in his business career, or in the 
5 years he led the Navy, John has always been a shining example of the 
best America has to offer.
    During Secretary Dalton's tenure, the Navy and Marine Corps have 
truly risen to the challenge of change, while reaffirming the core 
values that have always defined the Department of the Navy. His business 
acumen has helped to streamline and strengthen operations, and he has 
worked ceaselessly to extend opportunity to every sailor and Marine, 
helping draw strength from our rich diversity.
    I thank him for his service, and for his friendship.
