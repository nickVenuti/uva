Memorandum on Assistance to the Russian Federation

May 23, 1998

Presidential Determination No. 98-23

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

Subject: Assistance Program for the Government of the Russian Federation

    Pursuant to section 577(a) of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public Law 
105-118), I hereby determine and certify that the Government of the 
Russian Federation has implemented no statute, executive order, 
regulation, or similar government action that would discriminate, or 
would have as its principal effect discrimination, against religious 
groups or religious communities in the Russian Federation in violation 
of accepted international agreements on human rights and religious 
freedoms to which the Russian Federation is a party. During the period 
under review, the Government of Russia has applied the new Russian Law 
on Religion in a manner that is not in conflict with its international 
obligations on religious freedom. However, this issue requires continued 
and close monitoring as the Law on Religion furnishes regional officials 
with an instrument that can be interpreted and used to restrict the 
activities of religious minorities.
    You are authorized and directed to notify the Congress of this 
determination and to arrange for its publication in the Federal 
Register.
                                            William J. Clinton
