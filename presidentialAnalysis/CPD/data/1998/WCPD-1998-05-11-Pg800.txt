Message on the Observance of Cinco de Mayo, 1998

May 5, 1998

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
    On this day in 1862, brave Mexicans stood up against seemingly 
overwhelming odds to defend their right to self-determination, and they 
emerged victorious. It is their spirit and their valiant contribution to 
the cause of freedom that we celebrate today.
    This annual commemoration of the Mexican Army's triumph at the 
Battle of Puebla gives us a wonderful opportunity to celebrate

the richness of Mexico's cultural contributions to U.S. society and the 
long-standing ties of friendship between our two peoples. The reverence 
for freedom that we share has been the firm foundation of our 
relationship in the past and will continue to strengthen us as we look 
forward to the promise of the future.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a memorable 
celebration.
                                                  Bill Clinton
