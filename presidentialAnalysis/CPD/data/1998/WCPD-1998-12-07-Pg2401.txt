Radio Remarks Announcing Housing Grants for People With AIDS

December 1, 1998

    For too many Americans living with AIDS, poverty is nearly as much a 
threat as the disease itself. People with AIDS face enormous medical 
bills and are often too sick to hold a job. Without our help, many would 
be forced to live in unfit housing or even to become homeless. We must 
not turn our backs on these Americans when they need us most. Today I am 
announcing $221 million in grants that will help meet the housing needs 
of the 85,000 Americans who have AIDS and those who live with a family 
member with the disease. These grants, administered by the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, will mean that people fighting AIDS don't 
have to also fight to keep a roof over their heads.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 5:47 p.m. 
on November 24 in the Oval Office at the White House for later 
broadcast. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on December 1.
