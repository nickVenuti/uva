Statement on Progress Against Drunk Driving

August 24, 1998

    The data released today by the Department of Transportation shows 
that we are making real progress in protecting Americans from drunk 
drivers. Last year, the number of people killed in alcohol-related 
crashes dropped to an all-time low, representing a decline of over a 
third since 1982. For the first time since we started keeping these 
statistics in 1975, drunk driving deaths accounted for less than 40 
percent of all traffic deaths. And alcohol-related fatalities among 16- 
to 20-year-olds dropped by 5 percent last year alone.
    Our progress is the result of stronger laws, tougher enforcement, 
and increased public awareness. In particular, today's statistics show 
the importance of the legislation I fought for and signed 3 years ago to 
ensure zero tolerance for underage drinking and driving. But there is 
more we must do. We could save even more lives by passing a tough 
national standard of impaired driving at .08 blood alcohol content 
(BAC)--and I continue to challenge the Congress to enact this life-
saving measure. If we work together, we can spare thousands of families 
from the grief and anger of losing a loved one to a preventable drunk 
driving crash, and make our roads, highways, and communities safer for 
all Americans.
