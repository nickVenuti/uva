Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report of the National Science 
Board

June 26, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:

    As required by 42 U.S.C. 1863(j)(1), I am pleased to submit to the 
Congress a report of the National Science Board entitled Science and 
Engineering Indicators--1998. This report represents the thirteenth in a 
series examining key aspects of the status of American science and 
engineering in a global environment.
    Investments in science and engineering research and education have 
enjoyed bipartisan support. They are critical to America's ability to 
maintain world leadership and fulfill our potential as a Nation as we 
begin the transition into the 21st century.
    This report provides a broad base of quantitative information about 
U.S. science, engineering, and technology in an international context. I 
commend Science and Engineering Indicators--1998 to the attention of the 
Congress and those in the scientific and technology communities. It will 
assist us in better understanding the new developments and trends in 
what is rapidly becoming a global knowledge-based economy.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
June 25, 1998.
