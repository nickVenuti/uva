Statement on Signing the Women's Health Research and Prevention 
Amendments of 1998

October 31, 1998

    Today I am pleased to sign into law S. 1722, the ``Women's Health 
Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998,'' which will significantly 
advance women's health by strengthening national efforts to improve 
research and screening on diseases with particular impact on women, 
including osteoporosis, breast and ovarian cancer, and cardiovascular 
diseases.
    This bill will authorize several women's health and research 
screening activities at the National Institutes of Health and the 
Centers for Disease Control for the next 5 years. It will expand 
coordinated Federal research into heart disease, strokes, and other 
cardiovascular diseases among women. In addition, life-saving screening 
for breast and cervical cancer will continue to be made available to 
thousands of low-income women.
    I commend the sponsors of this bipartisan legislation, including 
Senator Bill Frist and cosponsors Senators Barbara Boxer, Barbara 
Mikulski, and Patty Murray, for their contributions that will help 
protect women from these deadly diseases and advance our scientific 
knowledge.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
October 31, 1998.

Note: S. 1722, approved October 31, was assigned Public Law No. 105-340.
