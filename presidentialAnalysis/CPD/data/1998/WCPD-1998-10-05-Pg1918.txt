Statement on the Election of Gerhard Schroeder as Chancellor of Germany

September 27, 1998

    Today the German people have once again exercised their democratic 
right to determine their national leadership. I extend my sincerest 
congratulations to Gerhard Schroeder. He and I had good discussions in 
Berlin this spring and in Washington this summer. I look forward to 
working closely with him. Germany is one of America's closest allies. As 
always, our two governments will be fully engaged in a comprehensive 
policy agenda.
    I also want to convey my gratitude and that of all Americans to 
Helmut Kohl. During his 16-year tenure, he has made historic 
contributions to the unity of his nation, the strength of our Euro-
Atlantic community, and to peace throughout the world.
