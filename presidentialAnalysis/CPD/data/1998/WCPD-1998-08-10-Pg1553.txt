Statement on Congressional Action on Job Training Reform Legislation

July 31, 1998

    I am pleased that both Houses of Congress have now passed a 
comprehensive bill to give Americans new opportunities and choices to 
train for the jobs of the future. This bill will modernize job training 
to fit the needs of today's economy, and I appreciate the bipartisan 
spirit that prevailed in getting that done. Modeled on my GI bill for 
America's workers, this new training bill streamlines the vast array of 
existing job programs and empowers individuals to learn new skills with 
a simple grant. It makes sure that job training helps Americans meet the 
demand of a rapidly changing economy, and I look forward to signing it 
into law.
