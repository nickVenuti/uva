Statement on the Solar Energy Systems Partnership

June 25, 1998

    I would like to applaud the announcement today of a new partnership 
to help meet the challenge of global warming by making it easier for 
homeowners to tap clean energy from the Sun.
    Last June, I announced an initiative with the goal of placing solar 
energy panels on one million roofs around the Nation by 2010. Just a 
year later, the Department of Energy already has received commitments 
for more than half a million installations. This new partnership between 
the General Motors 
Acceptance Corporation and the Solar Energy Industries Association will 
make low-cost loans for solar energy systems available nationwide, 
helping us to meet our goal even faster.
    This agreement demonstrates that through partnerships and the power 
of the marketplace, we can reduce greenhouse gas pollution while saving 
consumers money and creating new economic opportunities. I encourage 
other businesses to seek creative ways to meet the challenge of climate 
change. And I urge Congress to help speed this effort by funding my 
proposals for a solar energy tax credit and other tax and research 
incentives for energy efficiency and clean power.
