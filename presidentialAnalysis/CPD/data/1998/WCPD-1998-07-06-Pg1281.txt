Statement on the Identification of Vietnam War Unknown Soldier

June 30, 1998

    DNA testing positively identified the remains of the Vietnam War 
unknown disinterred from the Tomb of the Unknowns in May as those of the 
Air Force 1st Lt. Michael J. Blassie. The Defense Department has 
notified the Blassie family and the other families involved in resolving 
this difficult case. I am pleased that one more family has finally 
learned the fate of a loved one, and I remain committed to seeking a 
full accounting of the missing in action from that conflict.
