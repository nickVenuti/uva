Statement on Federal Election Commission Action on Campaign Finance 
Reform

February 3, 1998

    I strongly support action to end the soft money raised by both 
political parties. That is why last year I asked the Federal Election 
Commission to ban soft money, under its current legal authority. I am 
very pleased that the agency's General Counsel has proposed a new rule 
prohibiting national parties from raising soft money. Now I ask the 
members of the Commission to step up to their responsibility and act, 
within their legal authority, to end the soft money system.
