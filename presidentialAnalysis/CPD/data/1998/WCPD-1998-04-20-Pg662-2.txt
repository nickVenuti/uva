Statement on Tornado Damage in Arkansas and Tennessee

April 16, 1998

    I was deeply saddened to learn this morning of the tragic deaths of 
two small children

in Arkansas, as well as the deaths of two individuals from Dyer County, 
Tennessee. My heart goes out to their parents and families and to the 
many who have suffered in both States. The destruction of last night's 
tornadoes was swift and powerful, and the threat of another storm looms 
in its wake.

    Disaster relief efforts began today at daybreak. James Lee Witt, the 
Director of FEMA, will provide me with an assessment of the destruction 
and FEMA is standing ready to respond if appropriate. The burden of 
recovery is heavy, but it will not be carried by these communities 
alone. Our thoughts and prayers are with the survivors as they mourn all 
that was lost and begin the difficult process of healing and rebuilding.
