Statement on the Accident Involving United States Aircraft in Italy

February 3, 1998

    I was deeply saddened to learn a short while ago that a U.S. 
military jet aircraft was involved in an accident in Italy that resulted 
in the deaths of several Italian citizens.
    The plane is part of the U.S. force stationed at Aviano Air Base in 
Italy that is supporting the NATO SFOR mission in Bosnia. U.S. military 
authorities in Aviano have launched an investigation into this accident. 
I have expressed my condolences to Prime Minister Prodi and assured him 
that we will cooperate fully with the Italian Government and do 
everything we can to find out what happened and prevent an accident like 
this from happening again.
    On behalf of the American people I offer my heartfelt sympathy to 
the families and friends of those killed and injured in this accident.

Note: In the statement, the President referred to Prime Minister Romano 
Prodi of Italy.
