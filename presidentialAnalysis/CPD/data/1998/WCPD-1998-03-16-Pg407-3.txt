Message to the Congress Transmitting a Waiver on Most-Favored-Nation 
Status for Vietnam

March 9, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:

    Pursuant to section 402(c)(2)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (the ``Act''), I have determined that a waiver of the 
application of subsections 402(a) and (b) with respect to Vietnam will 
substantially promote the objectives of section 402. A copy of that 
determination is attached. I also have received assurances with respect 
to the emigration practices of Vietnam required by section 402(c)(2)(B) 
of the Act. This message constitutes the report to the Congress required 
by section 402(c)(2).
    Pursuant to subsection 402(c)(2) of the Act, I shall issue an 
Executive order waiving the application of subsections (a) and (b) of 
section 402 of the Act with respect to Vietnam.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
March 9, 1998.
