Statement on the Settlement of Holocaust Assets Lawsuits

August 13, 1998

    I am pleased that Holocaust survivors and private Swiss banks 
reached a settlement of several pending lawsuits. Both sides 
demonstrated understanding, flexibility, and determination in reaching a 
settlement that, once approved by the district court, will bring long-
delayed justice to Holocaust victims and their families.
    I applaud the work of the World Jewish Congress and key Members of 
the U.S. Congress for their roles in focusing attention on this 
important issue and for their strong advocacy on behalf of the 
claimants.
    I also commend the active role played by Under Secretary Stuart 
Eizenstat and his team at the State Department, whose work with the 
parties earlier this year laid the groundwork for a settlement.
