Statement on the Death of Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

August 25, 1998

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened by the death of Justice Lewis F. 
Powell, Jr., one of our most thoughtful and conscientious Justices. For 
over 15 years on the Supreme Court, he approached each case without an 
ideological agenda, carefully applying the Constitution, the law, and 
Supreme Court precedent regardless of his own personal views about the 
case. His opinions were a model of balance and judiciousness. As a 
result, he was the decisive voice on the Court in addressing some of the 
most important issues of our day.

    Justice Powell was an admirable public servant. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with his loved ones.
