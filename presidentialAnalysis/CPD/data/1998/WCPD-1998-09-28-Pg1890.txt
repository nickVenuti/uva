Statement on the National Economy

September 25, 1998

    Today, we received more proof that our economic strategy is working 
to deepen America's prosperity and widen the circle of opportunity to 
more American families. Over the past year, personal incomes have 
increased 5.0 percent--much faster than the rate of inflation. While our 
economic progress is strong, now is not a time to rest; it is a time to 
build.
    To keep our economy on the right track, we must maintain our three-
part economic strategy. We must maintain our fiscal discipline by 
reserving every penny of the budget surplus until we have strengthened 
Social Security. We must continue to invest in our people through 
education, health care, and research and development. And we have to 
continue to lead the global economy and meet our obligation to the 
International Monetary Fund.
