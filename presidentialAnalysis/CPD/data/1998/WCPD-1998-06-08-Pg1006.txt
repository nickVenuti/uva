Statement on Support for Russian Reform

May 31, 1998

    On Friday, I welcomed Russia's new economic program for 1998 and 
encouraged strong IMF and World Bank engagement in support of reform. 
Implementation of this program will strengthen the fundamentals of the 
Russian economy and foster maintenance of a stable ruble. Following my 
conversation with President Yeltsin last week, we directed our officials 
to consult on the Russian economic and financial situation. The United 
States endorses additional conditional financial support from the 
international financial institutions, as necessary, to promote 
stability, structural reforms, and growth in Russia.
