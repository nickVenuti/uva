Excerpt of Videotape Remarks on the United States-Iran World Cup Game

June 18, 1998

    The World Cup is beloved across our planet because it offers a 
chance for people from around the world to be judged not by the place 
they grew up, the color of their skin, or the way they choose to 
worship, but by their spirit, skill, and strength.
    As we cheer today's game between American and Iranian athletes, I 
hope it can be another step toward ending the estrangement between our 
nations. I am pleased that over the last year, President Khatami and I 
have both worked to encourage more people-to-people exchanges, and to 
help our citizens develop a better understanding of each other's rich 
civilizations.

Note: The President's remarks were videotaped at approximately 11 a.m. 
in the Cabinet Room on June 18 for broadcast on Univision on June 21, 
and the partial transcript was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on June 18. A tape was not available for verification of the 
content of this address.
