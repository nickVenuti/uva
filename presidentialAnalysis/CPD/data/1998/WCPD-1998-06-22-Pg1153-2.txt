Statement on Action To Cut Teen Drug Use

June 18, 1998

    Today's PRIDE survey shows that American families can influence 
adolescents' attitudes and behaviors when it comes to drugs. This is a 
small step in the right direction. But we must all continue to warn our 
youth that drugs are wrong; that drugs are dangerous; and that drugs can 
kill you. That is why in the coming months, we will take our antidrug 
media campaign nationwide, fund more community antidrug coalitions, and 
work to enact our long-term drug strategy. These and other steps will 
help us to reach our ultimate goal--cutting teen drug use in half.
