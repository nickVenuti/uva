Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process

September 1, 1998

    I join Prime Ministers Blair and Ahern in welcoming today's 
statement by Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams committing to exclusively 
democratic and peaceful means in the political process in Northern 
Ireland. Sinn Fein joins its voice to the vast majority of Northern 
Ireland's people who are determined to see, in Mr. Adams' words, that 
``violence is a thing of the past, over, done with, and gone.'' This 
statement is an important contribution to building the trust and 
confidence necessary to make the Good Friday accord a reality.
    I am looking forward to meeting personally with all the party 
leaders in Northern Ireland. I will urge them to work for full and 
speedy implementation of the Good Friday accord--the best way to put an 
end to conflict and ensure peace in Northern Ireland.
