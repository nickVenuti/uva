Message to the Congress Transmitting the District of Columbia Court's 
Fiscal Year 1999 Budget Request

March 16, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the District of Columbia Code, as amended, I am 
transmitting the District of Columbia Court's FY 1999 budget request.
    The District of Columbia Courts has submitted a FY 1999 budget 
request for $133 million for its operating expenditures and 
authorization for multiyear capital funding totalling $58 million for 
courthouse renovation and improvements. My FY 1999 Budget includes 
recommended funding levels of $121 million for operations and $21 
million for capital improvements for the District Courts. My transmittal 
of the District Court's budget request does not represent an endorsement 
of its contents.
    I look forward to working with the Congress throughout the FY 1999 
appropriation process.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
March 16, 1998.
