Statement on the Bombings in South Africa and Uganda

August 26, 1998

    Hillary and I join the American people in extending our deepest 
sympathies to the victims of bomb attacks in South Africa and Uganda on 
August 25, and to their families and friends. We reaffirm our 
unshakeable friendship and support for them and for all of the people of 
South Africa and Uganda.
    The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms these 
senseless attacks on innocent civilians that have taken the lives of at 
least 29 Ugandans and 2 South Africans.
    Earlier this month, South Africa provided immediate and invaluable 
assistance to the United States, Kenya, and Tanzania in the wake of the 
bombings of the U.S. Embassies in those countries. We are grateful for 
the generous response and will do what we can to assist South Africa and 
Uganda in the wake of these senseless acts.
