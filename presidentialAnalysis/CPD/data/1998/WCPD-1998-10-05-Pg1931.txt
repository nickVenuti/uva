Statement on Senate Action on the ``Year 2000 Information and Readiness 
Disclosure Act''

September 29, 1998

    I am pleased that the Senate last night passed the ``Year 2000 
Information and Readiness Disclosure Act,'' important bipartisan 
legislation to help our Nation prepare its computer systems for the new 
millennium.
    This bill, which builds upon a proposal my administration submitted 
to Congress in July, will help businesses, State and local government, 
and Federal agencies better address the year 2000 (Y2K) problem by 
providing limited liability protections to encourage greater information 
sharing about solutions, while also protecting consumers from misleading 
advertising or other statements when purchasing products for their own 
use.
    January 1, 2000, is one deadline we cannot push back. I urge the 
House to pass this critical legislation before the end of the 
legislative session. I look forward to signing it into law so that Y2K 
information sharing will enable the Nation to prepare for this global 
challenge.
