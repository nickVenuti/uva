To the Senate of the United States:

    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of 
Latvia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal 
Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Washington on January 
15, 1998. Also transmitted is the report of the Department of State

    This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United 
States and OECD nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to 
various types of income

and protection from double taxation of income. The Convention also 
provides for resolution of disputes and sets forth rules making its 
benefits unavailable to residents that are engaged in treaty shopping.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Convention and that the Senate give its advice and consent to 
ratification.
