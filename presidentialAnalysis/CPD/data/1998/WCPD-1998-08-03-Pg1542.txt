Proclamation 7112--Designation of American Heritage Rivers

July 30, 1998

By the President of the United States

of America

A Proclamation

    In celebration of America's rivers, and to recognize and reward 
grassroots efforts to restore them, last year I announced the American 
Heritage Rivers initiative. My goal was to help communities realize 
their visions for their rivers by making it easier for them to tap 
existing programs and resources of the Federal Government. From across 
the country, hundreds of communities answered my call for nominations, 
asking that their rivers be designated American Heritage Rivers. I 
applaud all of the communities that have drawn together and dedicated 
themselves to the goal of healthy rivers, now and forever.
    Having reviewed the recommendations of the American Heritage Rivers 
Initiative Advisory Committee, I am pleased to be able to recognize a 
select group of rivers and communities that reflect the true diversity 
and splendor of America's natural endowment, and the tremendous energy 
and commitment of its citizenry.
    Pursuant to Executive Orders 13061, 13080, and 13093, I hereby 
designate the following American Heritage Rivers:
<bullet>    The Blackstone and Woonasquatucket Rivers, in the States of 
            Massachusetts and Rhode Island;
<bullet>    The Connecticut River, in the States of Connecticut, 
            Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont;
<bullet>    The Cuyahoga River, in the State of Ohio;
<bullet>    The Detroit River, in the State of Michigan;
<bullet>    The Hanalei River, in the State of Hawaii;
<bullet>    The Hudson River, in the State of New York;
<bullet>    The Upper Mississippi River, in the States of Illinois, 
            Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin;
<bullet>    The Lower Mississippi River, in the States of Louisiana and 
            Tennessee;
<bullet>    The New River, in the States of North Carolina, Virginia, 
            and West Virginia;
<bullet>    The Rio Grande, in the State of Texas;
<bullet>    The Potomac River, in the District of Columbia and the 
            States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West 
            Virginia;
<bullet>    The St. Johns River, in the State of Florida;
<bullet>    The Upper Susquehanna and Lackawanna Rivers, in the State of 
            Pennsylvania;
<bullet>    The Willamette River, in the State of Oregon.
    In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day 
of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-eight, and 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                            William J. Clinton
