Statement on House of Representatives Action on Agriculture Legislation

June 5, 1998

    I commend the House of Representatives for joining the Senate in 
passing by an overwhelming majority the bipartisan agriculture research 
bill. This legislation restores benefits to thousands of deserving legal 
immigrants who will now be able to rely on much-needed food stamp 
assistance. It builds on our success last year in reversing harsh cuts 
in SSI and Medicaid benefits for legal immigrants that had nothing to do 
with our goal of moving people from welfare to work. With these actions, 
the Congress has gone a long way toward fulfilling the commitment I made 
to reverse this unfair treatment of legal immigrants. At the same time, 
the bill funds crucial agricultural research, crop insurance, and rural 
development priorities which will strengthen the farm safety net and 
enhance the quality of life in rural America.

    I would like to congratulate Representatives Smith and Stenholm for 
their excellent work in crafting and stewarding through the House this 
important legislation.
