Device by Pakistan

May 30, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Pursuant to section 102(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, I am 
hereby reporting that, in accordance with that section, I have 
determined that Pakistan, a non-nuclear-weapon state, detonated a 
nuclear explosive device on May 28, 1998. I have further directed the 
relevant agencies and instrumentalities of the United States Government 
to take the necessary actions to impose the sanctions described in 
section 102(b)(2) of that Act.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
