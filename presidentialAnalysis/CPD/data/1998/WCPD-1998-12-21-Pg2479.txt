Statement on Crime Rates

December 13, 1998

    The preliminary crime data released by the FBI today confirm that 
crime rates in America are continuing to decline for the seventh 
straight year. During the first 6 months of 1998, serious crime fell by 
another 5 percent--with large reductions in murder and other violent 
crimes leading the way. If these trends hold for the remainder of the 
year, the number of murders will have been cut by nearly one-third since 
Vice President Gore and I took office. This is remarkable progress, and 
it shows that our strategy of more police, tougher gun laws, and better 
crime prevention is making a difference. But our work is far from done. 
In the coming year, as we finish the job of putting 100,000 more police 
on the streets, we must continue to do everything we can to make all of 
our communities safer.
