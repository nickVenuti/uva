Statement on the Election of Representative Jim Clyburn To Chair the 
Congressional Black Caucus

November 17, 1998

    I am pleased that Representative Jim Clyburn was elected by his 
colleagues to chair the Congressional Black Caucus. In January 
Representative Clyburn will begin his fourth term representing the 
people of the Sixth District of South Carolina. Throughout his career, 
he has been a tireless advocate for his constituents and he has been a 
national leader on issues including rural economic development and 
affirmative action.
    I commend outgoing CBC Chairwoman Maxine Waters for her outstanding 
leadership of the caucus, and I am confident that Representative Clyburn 
will be a most able successor. I look forward to working with Chairman 
Clyburn and the entire Congressional Black Caucus during the 106th 
Congress.
