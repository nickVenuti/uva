Statement on Proposed Tobacco Legislation

May 6, 1998

    I commend Representatives Hansen and Meehan for their hard work in 
putting together a strong bipartisan comprehensive tobacco bill designed 
to reduce youth smoking in this country. The Hansen-Meehan bill contains 
a substantial price increase, strong industry and company penalties for 
failure to reduce youth smoking, full FDA authority to regulate tobacco, 
strong restrictions on advertising and youth marketing of tobacco 
products, and strong protections against exposure to environmental 
tobacco smoke. I look forward to working with them to ensure that their 
legislation adequately protects tobacco farmers and to pass a 
comprehensive tobacco bill this year.
