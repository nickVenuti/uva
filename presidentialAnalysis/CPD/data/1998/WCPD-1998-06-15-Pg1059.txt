Statement on the House of Representatives Republican Budget Proposal

June 5, 1998

    Over the past 5 years, we have followed an economic strategy of 
fiscal discipline coupled with smart investments in education, health 
care, and the environment. That strategy has eliminated the deficit and 
helped spur economic growth and the creation of more than 16 million new 
jobs. The House Republican budget is an unfortunate step backwards that 
would mean severe and unnecessary cuts in education, the environment, 
and health care. At a time when Washington is seeing its first surplus 
in almost 30 years and spending as a share of the economy is at its 
lowest level in a quarter century, this budget is not the right 
approach. As Congress readies its final budget, I urge Members to 
continue our strategy of fiscal discipline and strategic investments to 
prepare our country for the 21st century.
