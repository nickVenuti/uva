Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on Penalties for Drug 
Traffickers Who Carry Firearms

June 8, 1998

    I applaud the Supreme Court's decision today to make sure that drug 
traffickers who carry firearms, whether on their person or in their car, 
are subject to the stiffest penalties possible. Crime rates have fallen 
in America for 6 years in a row, but guns and drugs remain serious 
problems among our youth and in many of our neighborhoods. Today's 
decision is one more victory for law enforcement and law abiding 
citizens in the fight against crime and drugs.
