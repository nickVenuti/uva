Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Emigration 
Policies of Mongolia

January 20, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    On September 4, 1996, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Mongolia was not in violation of the freedom of emigration criteria of 
sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This action allowed for 
the continuation of most-favored-nation status for Mongolia and certain 
other activities without the requirement of an annual waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the 
Congress concerning the emigration laws and policies of Mongolia. The 
report indicates continued Mongolian compliance with U.S. and 
international standards in the area of emigration.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on January 21.
