Statement Announcing a Presidential Mission to Central America To Assist 
in the Aftermath of Hurricane Mitch

November 5, 1998

    The United States has close and longstanding ties with the people 
and governments of Central America, and many Americans have close family 
and cultural ties to these countries. In light of the devastation caused 
by Hurricane Mitch, I have asked Tipper Gore to lead a Presidential 
mission to Honduras and Nicaragua. Mrs. Gore will travel to the region 
November 10-11, 1998, to demonstrate our commitment to assist the people 
of Central America as they recover from this catastrophe.
    Mrs. Gore will deliver supplies and participate in disaster relief 
efforts. She will be joined by U.S. Agency for International Development 
Administrator Brian Atwood and Members of Congress on the mission. I 
believe that this trip will expand awareness throughout the U.S. and the 
world of the devastation faced by the people of Central America in order 
to encourage a global relief effort.
