Statement on Efforts To Cut Teen Drug Use

June 25, 1998

    Last week's PRIDE survey showed that we are beginning to change the 
attitudes and behavior of our children, and that is a step in the right 
direction. Today's Pulse Check shows that the work of America's parents, 
teachers, and public officials is far from done. America's young people 
need to hear a single, unambiguous message: Drugs are wrong and 
dangerous, and they can kill you. This survey also indicates that we 
must continue our efforts to toughen drug enforcement and to get 
hardened drug users off the street and into mandatory testing and 
treatment.
