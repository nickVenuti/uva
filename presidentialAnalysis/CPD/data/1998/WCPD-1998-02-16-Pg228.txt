Statement on the Accident Involving United States Aircraft in the 
Persian Gulf

February 7, 1998

    Defending America's interests is difficult, dangerous work--and our 
men and women in uniform bear that burden every day. Nowhere is their 
service more important than in the Persian Gulf.
    I was saddened to learn that one of our Marine Corps F/A-18 pilots, 
Lieutenant Colonel Henry G. Van Winkle II, lost his life yesterday in 
the skies over the Persian Gulf. Lieutenant Colonel Van Winkle was there 
as part of America's commitment to back up our determined diplomacy with 
force as we work to prevent Saddam Hussein from threatening the world 
with weapons of mass destruction.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones--and with all our 
men and women in uniform around the world as they serve and sacrifice 
every day to keep Americans safe and America strong.
