Statement on Indictment of Mexican Bankers Involved in Laundering Drug 
Money

May 18, 1998

    I am pleased that the Treasury Department and the United States 
Customs Service have joined today with the Justice Department to take a 
significant step to protect our Nation and its children from drugs. The 
indictments today send a clear message that those who help finance drug 
operations, who launder drug money, who make it possible for drug 
dealers to earn their illegal profits, will not escape the long arm of 
our Nation's law enforcement. We still have much to do, but let no one 
doubt that we will press this fight relentlessly against the drug 
cartels and all their partners in crime.
