Statement on the Death of Gene Autry

October 2, 1998

    Hillary and I are saddened to learn of the death of Gene Autry. An 
entire generation of Americans has lost a beloved old friend from 
childhood. Gene Autry's music and movies captured all that was good and 
inspiring about America's Old West. His characters taught children 
across America important lessons about courage and freedom, justice and 
fairplay. And in leaving behind a treasure trove of recordings--from 
``Back in the Saddle Again'' to ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' 
America's First Singing Cowboy will sing forever. Our thoughts and 
prayers go out to the Autry family.
