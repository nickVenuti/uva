Statement on the Death of Tom Bradley

September 29, 1998

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Mayor Tom 
Bradley. The son of a sharecropper who became a police lieutenant, he 
rose to lead our Nation's second largest city for two decades. He was a 
builder, bringing a remarkably successful Olympic Games to Los Angeles, 
encouraging a thriving downtown and improving mass transit. Just as 
important, he built bridges across the lines that divide us, uniting 
people of many races and backgrounds in the most diverse city in 
America. He was a pioneer and a leader. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with Ethel and their family.
