Law is working. Since its passage, law enforcement officials have 
stopped hundreds of thousands of felons, fugitives, and stalkers from 
buying handguns every year. By keeping guns out of the hands of 
criminals--and putting more police in our communities--we have helped 
cut the crime rate to its lowest point in a generation. We must now 
extend the Brady Law's provisions to violent juveniles and bar them from 
owning guns for life. I call on Congress once again to pass this needed, 
commonsense legislation.
