Statement on the Resignation of John Garamendi as Deputy Secretary of 
the Interior

April 9, 1998

    It is with regret that I accept the resignation of John Garamendi as 
Deputy Secretary of the Interior.
    For almost 3 years, John has been a very important member of my 
administration and has successfully handled some of the toughest and 
most complicated issues in one of the largest and most important 
agencies in the Federal Government. From California water issues to the 
protection of Headwaters redwoods, John's ability to find common ground 
and creative solutions has been a great asset.
    I wish him the best for the future.
