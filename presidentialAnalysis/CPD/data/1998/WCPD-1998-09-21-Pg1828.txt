Statement on British Petroleum's Action to Reduce Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions

September 18, 1998

    I applaud the leadership demonstrated today by British Petroleum 
with its plan to dramatically reduce emissions contributing to global 
warming.
    By committing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10 percent 
below 1990 levels by the year 2010, British Petroleum is setting a new 
standard in corporate responsibility. The company plans to meet its 
ambitious target through a cost-effective strategy that combines 
innovative market-based approaches with the latest in energy-efficiency 
technologies. British Petroleum's bold strategy is further proof that we 
need not choose between a healthy economy and a healthy environment.
    I urge other businesses to follow British Petroleum's lead and help 
meet the challenge of global warming. And I again call on Congress to 
help speed this effort by funding my proposals for new tax incentives 
and research investment to spur energy efficiency and clean energy 
technologies.
