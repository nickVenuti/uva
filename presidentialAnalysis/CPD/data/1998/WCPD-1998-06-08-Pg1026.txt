Message to the Congress Transmitting a Waiver on Most-Favored-Nation 
Status for China

June 3, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:

    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''), with respect to the 
continuation of a waiver of application of subsections (a) and (b) of 
section 402 of the Act to the People's Republic of China. This document 
constitutes my recommendation to continue in effect this waiver for a 
further 12-month period and includes my determination that continuation 
of the waiver currently in effect for the People's Republic of China 
will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act, and 
my reasons for such determinations.

                                            William J. Clinton

The White House,
June 3, 1998.
