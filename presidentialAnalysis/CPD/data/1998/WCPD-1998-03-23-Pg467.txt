Statement on the Agreement on Taxes on the Internet

March 19, 1998

    In my recent speech on the future of the Internet, I called for a 
short-term moratorium on new and discriminatory taxes that would slow 
down the growth of the Internet and a search for long-term solutions to 
the tax issues raised by electronic commerce. We cannot allow 30,000 
State and local tax jurisdictions to stifle the Internet, but neither 
can we allow the erosion of the revenue that State and local governments 
need to fight crime and invest in education.
    I believe that the agreement reached by groups representing State 
and local elected officials is an important and constructive step toward 
a long-term solution. I particularly want to thank Governors Leavitt and 
Romer for their bipartisan leadership on this important issue. I look 
forward to working with all parties with a stake in this issue to enact 
legislation this year.

Note: In the statement, the President referred to Gov. Michael O. 
Leavitt of Utah and Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado.
