Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Emigration 
Policies of Albania

January 21, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I am submitting an updated report to the Congress concerning the 
emigration laws and policies of Albania. The report indicates continued 
Albanian compliance with U.S. and

international standards in the area of emigration. In fact, Albania has 
imposed no emigration restrictions, including exit visa requirements, on 
its population since 1991.
    On December 5, 1997, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Albania was in full compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria 
of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. That action allowed 
for the continuation of most-favored-nation (MFN) status for Albania and 
certain other activities without the requirement of an annual waiver. 
This semiannual report is submitted as required by law pursuant to the 
determination of December 5, 1997.
    Sincerely,
                                                  Bill Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on January 22.
