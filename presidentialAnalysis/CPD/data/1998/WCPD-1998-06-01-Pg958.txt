Radio Remarks on the Passage of the Northern Ireland Peace Accord 
Referendum

May 23, 1998

    Today we are rejoicing at the news from across the Atlantic. The 
people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have decisively 
approved the April 10th peace accord. It is the culmination of a 
springtime of peace, and it must be the beginning of a long season of 
happiness and prosperity.
    I salute the leaders who stood for hope against fear, the future 
against the past, unity against division. Most of all, I congratulate 
the Irish people for having the courage and wisdom to vote for a 
brighter future for their children.
    As of today, peace is no longer a dream, it is a reality. You have 
indeed joined hope to history. All over America, the eyes of Irish-
Americans, and indeed all our peace-loving citizens, are smiling. We are 
very proud of you.
    We pledge that we will work with you to build a better future for 
all of your people and ours.

Note: The President's remarks were prerecorded for later broadcast in 
Ireland. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
these remarks.
