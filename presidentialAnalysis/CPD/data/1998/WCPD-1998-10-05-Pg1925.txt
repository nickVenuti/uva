Message on the Observance of Yom Kippur, 1998

September 28, 1998

    Warm greetings to all those observing Yom Kippur.
    On the Day of Atonement, Jews across America and around the world 
fervently seek the blessing of forgiveness and reconciliation. The most 
solemn of Jewish holy days, Yom Kippur is a time of profound prayer, 
fasting, and self-examination.
    Amid the clamor and distraction of everyday life, Yom Kippur is a 
call for silence and reflection, a summons for believers to remember and 
repair their fundamental relationships with God and with their fellow 
human beings. It is a challenge to Jews and a reminder to Americans of 
all faiths to live our lives according to our beliefs: to have faith in 
God's mercy and to have the humility and strength of spirit to begin 
again.
    Best wishes for a blessed and meaningful Yom Kippur.
                                                  Bill Clinton
