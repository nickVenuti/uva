Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Political Status of 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico

March 4, 1998

    I am pleased that the House of Representatives has passed a bill 
which establishes a process for determining the future political status 
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The bill does not impose onerous, 
unworkable, unprecedented, or unconstitutional language requirements on 
the citizens of Puerto Rico, unlike some proposals that were advanced in 
Congress.
    I have always called for enabling Puerto Ricans to choose among 
options available for their future: continuing the Commonwealth 
arrangement, independence, or statehood--whatever future decided by 
majority choice. The House action is a victory for democracy and against 
exclusion. It is consistent with our country's repeated commitment to 
Puerto Rican self-determination, and consistent with the pride all 
Americans can take in the contributions those of Hispanic descent have 
made to all America.
