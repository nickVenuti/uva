Statement on Harold Ickes' 1996 Campaign Financing Activities

September 1, 1998

    Harold Ickes has been an important part of this administration's 
efforts to move our country forward and has devoted much of his life to 
improving the lives of all Americans. He has been a trusted adviser and 
a dedicated public servant. I am confident that investigators will find 
he acted lawfully and appropriately.
