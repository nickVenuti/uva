Presidential Determination No. 98-21

Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy

Subject: Presidential Determination on the Proposed Agreement for 
Cooperation Between the United States of America and Ukraine Concerning 
Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy

    I have considered the proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the 
United States of America and Ukraine Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear 
Energy, along with the views, recommendations, and statements of the 
interested agencies.
    I have determined that the performance of the agreement will 
promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common 
defense and security. Pursuant to section 123 b. of the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b)), I hereby approve the 
proposed agreement and authorize you to arrange for its execution.
    The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this 
determination in the Federal Register.
                                            William J. Clinton
