Statement on the Resignation of President Soeharto of Indonesia

May 20, 1998

    We welcome President Soeharto's decision, which provides an 
opportunity to begin a process leading to a real democratic transition 
in Indonesia--an opportunity for the Indonesian people to come together 
and build a stable democracy for the future. We urge Indonesia's leaders 
to move forward promptly with a peaceful process that enjoys broad 
public support. The United States stands ready to support Indonesia as 
it engages in democratic reform.
