Videotaped Remarks in a Message to Tracey Brown From Cape Town, South 
Africa

March 27, 1998

    Tracey, I wish you could have been with us when we heard President 
Rawlings in Ghana, President Museveni in Uganda, talking about your 
father and how much he did for Africa and how much he did to bring 
America and Africa in closer contact. And of course, on Saturday in 
Johannesburg, we dedicated the Ron Brown Commercial Center--your mom was 
there--to your dad's memory. His legacy will live on here because the 
center will promote economic progress and individual empowerment and 
democracy.
    Let me say that I've actually read your book from start to finish, 
and I loved it. And your daddy would be proud of it. And it's just sort 
of sassy and braggy enough, right where he was. [Laughter] So I hope you 
sell a zillion copies. You certainly deserve it, and I'm very, very 
proud of you.

Note: These remarks were videotaped at approximately 4:15 p.m. at the 
Cape Grace Hotel, to congratulate Ms. Brown on publication of her 
biography of her father, ``The Life and Times of Ron Brown.'' In his 
remarks, the President referred to Ms. Brown's mother, Alma Brown. A 
tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks. 
This item was not received in time for publication in the appropriate 
issue.
