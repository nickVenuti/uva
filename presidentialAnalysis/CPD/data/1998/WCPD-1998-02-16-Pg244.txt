Statement on Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt

February 11, 1998

    I have known Bruce Babbitt for many years. He is a man of the 
highest integrity and a dedicated public servant. I am convinced that 
when this matter is concluded he will be vindicated. I look forward to 
his continuing service to the American people.
