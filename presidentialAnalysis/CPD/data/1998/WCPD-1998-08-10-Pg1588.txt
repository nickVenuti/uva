Executive Order 13097--Interparliamentary Union

August 7, 1998

    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of the 
International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288), and having 
found that the Interparliamentary Union is a public international 
organization in which the United States participates within the meaning 
of the International Organizations Immunities Act, I hereby designate 
the Interparliamentary Union as a public international organization 
entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred 
by the International Organizations Immunities Act. This designation is 
not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, or 
immunities that such organization may have acquired or may acquire by 
international agreements or by congressional action.
