Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question. The previous submission covered progress through July 
31, 1997. The current submission covers the period August 1, 1997, to 
September 30, 1997.
    Highlights of the reporting period include the U.N. sponsored talks 
between President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash held in 
Glion-sur-Montreux, Switzerland; U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator 
Miller's trip to the region; and U.S. success in convening direct talks 
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders on security issues.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton
