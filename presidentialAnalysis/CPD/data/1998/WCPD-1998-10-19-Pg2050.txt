Agreement

October 14, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith

[[Page 2051]]

an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and 
the Government of the Republic of Estonia extending the Agreement of 
June 1, 1992, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, 
with annex, as extended (``the 1992 Agreement''). The present Agreement, 
which was effected by an exchange of notes in Tallinn on March 10 and 
June 11, 1998, extends the 1992 Agreement to June 30, 2000.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Republic of Estonia, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
