Statement on Secretary of Labor Alexis M. Herman

May 11, 1998

    Secretary Herman has served me and this administration with 
distinction. She is a person of integrity, a dedicated public servant, 
and an asset to working families all over America. I know her well, and 
I am confident she will not be distracted from the important

work she is doing. It is unfortunate that, despite no findings of 
wrongdoing by the Secretary, the Independent Counsel Act compels the 
Attorney General to recommend the appointment of an independent counsel 
in these circumstances. I look forward to the speedy resolution of this 
investigation. I am confident that in the end, investigators will also 
conclude that Ms. Herman did nothing wrong.
