Letter to Congressional Leaders on the China-United States Nuclear 
Cooperation Agreement

January 12, 1998

Dear Mr. Chairman:

    By separate letter, I have transmitted to the Speaker of the House, 
President of the Senate, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, and the Chairman of the House International Relations 
Committee the certification and unclassified report detailing the 
history and current developments in the nonproliferation policies and 
practices of the People's Republic of China that are required by Public 
Law 99-183, relating to the approval and implementation of the agreement 
for nuclear cooperation between the United States and the People's 
Republic of China.
    Because of the information controls on the classified report that 
the Administration has also prepared for Congress on China's 
nonproliferation policies and practices in fulfillment of the remaining 
requirement of Public Law 99-183, I am transmitting the required 
classified report directly to your Committee. The Administration regards 
the report transmitted herewith as containing sensitive intelligence and 
diplomatic information and requests that it be treated accordingly.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Richard C. Shelby, chairman, Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence, and Porter J. Goss, chairman, House 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. This letter was released by
