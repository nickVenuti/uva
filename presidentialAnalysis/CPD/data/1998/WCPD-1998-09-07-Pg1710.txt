Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process

September 3, 1998

    Yesterday's announcement that Martin McGuinness will oversee 
decommissioning issues for Sinn Fein is an important step. I welcome it 
as the kind of action essential not only to fulfill the Good Friday 
commitments, but to deepen public confidence in the overall process of 
making peace a reality in Northern Ireland.
