Statement on the United Nations Security Council Vote on Iraq

September 9, 1998

    I applaud the decisive and unanimous vote by the United Nations 
Security Council to suspend the review of sanctions against Iraq until 
Baghdad resumes full cooperation with the international weapons 
inspectors. Far from hastening the day sanctions are lifted, Iraq's 
failure to honor its obligations will prolong the sanctions, constrain 
Iraq from acquiring resources to rebuild its military, and keep the 
Iraqi economy under tight international control. The Security Council 
has made crystal clear that the burden remains on Iraq to declare and 
destroy all its nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and the 
missiles to deliver them.
