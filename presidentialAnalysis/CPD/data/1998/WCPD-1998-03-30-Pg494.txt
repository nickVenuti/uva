Statement on the Attack at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas

March 24, 1998

    Like all Americans, Hillary and I are deeply shocked and heartbroken 
by this afternoon's horrifying events at Westside Middle School in 
Jonesboro, Arkansas.
    We don't know now and we may never fully understand what could have 
driven two youths to deliberately shoot into a crowd of their 
classmates.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and 
the entire Jonesboro community.

Note: Two Westside Middle School students, ages 11 and 13, fired on 
other students during a fire drill, killing four female students and a 
teacher.
