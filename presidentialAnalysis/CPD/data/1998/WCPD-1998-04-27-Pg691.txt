Statement on House Action on Campaign Finance Reform

April 22, 1998

    I am very pleased that the House Republican leadership will heed the 
call of congressional reformers and allow a vote on campaign finance 
reform. I strongly support the bipartisan legislation offered by 
Representatives Christopher Shays and Marty Meehan, which is the best 
chance in a generation for real reform. Similar legislation already has 
the support of a majority of Senators, yet it has been blocked by a 
minority on procedural grounds. Now every Member of the House of 
Representatives has a responsibility to vote for this measure to ban 
large soft money contributions, improve disclosure, and restrict 
backdoor campaign spending. A vote for bipartisan campaign finance 
reform will be a vote to strengthen our democracy and give ordinary 
voters a stronger voice.
