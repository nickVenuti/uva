Statement on the 1997 National Crime Victimization Survey

December 27, 1998

    The 1997 National Crime Victimization Survey released by the 
Department of Justice today shows that violent crime fell 7 percent last 
year and 21 percent since I took office. With the violent crime rate now 
its lowest level since 1973, Americans are safer today than they have 
been in many years. These new figures again show that our strategy of 
more police, stricter gun laws, and better crime prevention is working. 
But we are not yet done. Working together, both in Washington and in 
communities across our Nation, we must redouble our efforts to make our 
streets, homes, and schools safer for all Americans.

Note: This statement was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary at 8 a.m. on December 27 but was embargoed for release until 9
