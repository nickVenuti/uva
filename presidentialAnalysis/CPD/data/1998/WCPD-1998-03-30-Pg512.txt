Statement on the Death of Representative Steven Schiff

March 26, 1998

    I was deeply saddened to hear that Congressman Steve Schiff has died 
after a courageous year-long battle with cancer. Hillary and I extend 
our sympathies to his wife, Marcia, and their two children. Steve's 
constituents in the First Congressional District of New Mexico and 
people across America have lost an effective legislator and an honorable 
public servant.
    His work on behalf of this Nation will long be remembered. Our 
thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.
