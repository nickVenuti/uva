Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting

July 29, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, as amended 
(47 U.S.C. 396(i)), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1997 and the 
Inventory of the Federal Funds Distributed to Public Telecommunications 
Entities by Federal Departments and Agencies: Fiscal Year 1997.
    Thirty years following the establishment of the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting, the Congress can take great pride in its creation. 
During these 30 years, the American public has been educated, inspired, 
and enriched by the programs and services made possible by this 
investment.
    The need for and the accomplishments of this national network of 
knowledge have never been more apparent, and as the attached 1997 annual 
CPB report indicates, by ``Going Digital,'' public broadcasting will 
have an ever greater capacity for fulfilling its mission.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
July 29, 1998.
