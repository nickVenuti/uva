and Management Assistance Act of 1995, I am transmitting the District of 
Columbia's Fiscal Year 1999 Budget Request Act.
    This proposed Fiscal Year 1999 Budget represents the major 
programmatic objectives of the Mayor, the Council of the District of 
Columbia, and the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and 
Management Assistance Authority. It also meets the financial stability 
and management improvement objectives of the National Capital 
Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. For Fiscal 
Year 1999, the District estimates revenues of $5.230 billion and total 
expenditures of $5.189 billion resulting in a $41 million budget 
surplus.
    My transmittal of the District of Columbia's budget, as required by 
law, does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
