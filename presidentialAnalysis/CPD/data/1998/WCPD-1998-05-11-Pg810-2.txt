Statement on Coerced Abstinence for Drug Offenders

May 6, 1998

    This week, the Connecticut legislature adopted a statewide policy of 
coerced abstinence for drug offenders. Two States--Connecticut and 
Maryland--have now joined the Federal Government in embracing tough 
systems of testing and sanctions for drug offenders. All States should 
follow their lead, and Congress should support their efforts. The choice 
is simple: cut crime and drug use by demanding that criminals kick their 
drug habits, or release drug offenders back into the community knowing 
they will commit more crimes to feed their addiction.
