Statement on Representative Newt Gingrich's Decision Not To Seek 
Reelection as Speaker of the House of Representatives

November 6, 1998

    Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary, leading the Republican 
party to a majority in the House, and joining me in a great national 
debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st century.
    Despite our profound differences, I appreciate those times we were 
able to work together in the national interest, especially Speaker 
Gingrich's strong support for America's continuing leadership for 
freedom, peace, and prosperity in the world.
