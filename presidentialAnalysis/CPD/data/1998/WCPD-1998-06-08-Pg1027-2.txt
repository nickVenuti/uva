Message to the Congress Transmitting a Waiver on Most-Favored-Nation 
Status for Belarus

June 3, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:

    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''), with respect to the 
continuation of a waiver of application of subsections (a) and (b) of 
section 402 of the Act. This document constitutes my recommendation to 
continue in effect this waiver for a further 12-month period and 
includes my determination that continuation of the waiver currently in 
effect for the Republic of Belarus will substantially promote the 
objectives of section 402 of the Act, and my reasons for such 
determination. I will submit separate reports with respect to Vietnam 
and the People's Republic of China.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
June 3, 1998.
