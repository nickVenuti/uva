Statement on the Death of Terry Sanford

April 18, 1998

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Terry Sanford.
    His long and distinguished career of public service as Governor, 
President of Duke University, and U.S. Senator helped build the New 
South and served as an inspiration to me and an entire generation of 
Americans. He stood for civil rights, education for all, and progressive 
economic development. His work and his influence literally changed the 
face and future of the South, making him one of the most influential 
Americans of the last 50 years. Most important, he was a wonderful man 
who fought for the right things in the right way.
    I was lucky to count him as a friend. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with Margaret Rose, Terry Jr., Betsee, and his entire family.
