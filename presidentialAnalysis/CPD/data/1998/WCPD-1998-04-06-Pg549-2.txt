Letter to Chairman Bud Shuster of the House Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure on Legislation Proposing a Uniform Standard Blood-
Alcohol Level

March 31, 1998

Dear Mr. Chairman:

    On March 28, 1998, I sent a letter to the Leadership addressing my 
concerns regarding H.R. 2400, the Building Efficient Surface 
Transportation and Equity Act of 1998. As the House prepares to consider 
this bill, it is my hope that the Lowey-Canady .08 provision be adopted.
    As the crime rate continues to drop nationwide, we still lose an 
American to drunk driving every thirty minutes--every half hour a family 
is shattered and a child, parent or neighbor is lost forever. Setting a 
uniform limit for impaired driving at .08 blood alcohol content will 
help us crack down on the drunk driving epidemic and put a stop to these 
needless deaths. In addition, a uniform standard will still allow adults 
to drink responsibly.
    This should not be a partisan issue, but rather an opportunity for 
the House to act

in a bipartisan fashion to save lives and serve America. I look forward 
to continuing to work together to make the .08 standard a reality.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton
