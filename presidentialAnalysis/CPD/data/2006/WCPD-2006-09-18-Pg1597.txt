Statement on the Visit of Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United 
Kingdom to the Middle East

September 9, 2006

    I am pleased that Prime Minister Blair will be visiting Lebanon, 
Israel, and the Palestinian territories. The deployment of increasing 
numbers of international forces in an enhanced United Nations Interim 
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which enabled the lifting of the air and sea 
blockade of Lebanon, makes this a timely visit. The Prime Minister will 
be discussing ways to facilitate the full implementation of United 
Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701, including enforcing 
the ban on unauthorized arms shipments to Hizballah from Iran and Syria. 
I understand the Prime Minister will also be exploring ways to advance 
the dialog between Israelis and Palestinians and the two-state 
solution--a democratic Israel and democratic Palestine living side by 
side in peace and security. I wish him well in his efforts to promote 
peace and stability in the region.
