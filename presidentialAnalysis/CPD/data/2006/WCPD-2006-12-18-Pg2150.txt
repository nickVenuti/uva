Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation To Reauthorize the 
Ryan White CARE Act

December 9, 2006

    In 1990, Congress passed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources 
Emergency (CARE) Act to advance our domestic battle against HIV/AIDS. 
This landmark legislation has provided Americans in need with better 
access to medical care, antiretroviral treatments, and counseling and 
has helped them live longer lives. The act also supports HIV testing to 
prevent the further spread of this devastating disease.
    Laura and I thank the House and Senate for reauthorizing the Ryan 
White CARE Act. This legislation focuses on life-saving and life-
extending services and increased accountability and will provide more 
flexibility to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to direct 
funding to areas of greatest need. The Ryan White CARE Act demonstrates 
the compassionate and generous spirit of America, and I look forward to 
signing this important legislation into law.
