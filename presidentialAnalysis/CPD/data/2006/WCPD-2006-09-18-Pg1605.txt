Statement on the Death of 
Ann Richards

September 14, 2006

     Laura and I are deeply saddened by the passing of Governor Ann 
Richards of Texas. Ann loved Texas, and Texans loved her. As a public 
servant, she earned respect and admiration. Ann became a national role 
model, and her charm, wit, and candor brought a refreshing vitality to 
public life. We extend our sympathies to Ann's family and friends. Texas 
has lost one of its great daughters.
