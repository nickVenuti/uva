Statement on the Death of Ed Bradley

November 9, 2006

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Ed Bradley. For over 
40 years, the American people have turned to Ed as a trusted source of 
information about events that have shaped our Nation. From serving as a 
White House correspondent to his many years as a journalist for a 
television newsmagazine, he produced distinctive investigative reports 
that inspired action and cemented his reputation as one of the most 
accomplished journalists of our time.
    Today our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Bradley's family and 
colleagues.
