Remarks Following a Tour of Victory Junction Gang Camp, Inc., in 
Randleman, North Carolina

October 18, 2006

    The President. You know, it's a remarkable place. I can't tell you 
how thrilled I am to be with the Pettys and the champion race car 
drivers who have heard a call to help people who need help. And I wish 
our fellow citizens could see the physical layout here; and if you were 
here, you'd also feel a great sense of compassion. And, you know, the 
Petty family has been well known for a long time in America. And they've 
been known as great athletes--now they will be known as great 
humanitarians as well.
    And so we really thank you.
    Kyle Petty. Thank you, sir.
    The President. This is a place that's in honor of their son, Adam. 
They have made a conscious decision to turn a tragic event into a loving 
event, and that's what I feel here. And you guys did a good job. Thanks 
for having me.
