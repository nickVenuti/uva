Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Energy Legislation

May 25, 2006

    I applaud the House of Representatives for passing the energy and 
water appropriations bill. I am grateful for the House leadership's work 
on it. This bill marks a critical first step toward realizing my 
American Competitiveness Initiative, and it fully funds my request for 
the Energy Department's Office of Science. I appreciate the leadership 
of Chairman Hobson and Chairman Lewis in working to keep our economy the 
most competitive in the world. This bill also will support my Advanced 
Energy Initiative and help make America more secure and less dependent 
on foreign sources of energy. I urge the Senate to join the House in 
supporting these important initiatives.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 5427.
