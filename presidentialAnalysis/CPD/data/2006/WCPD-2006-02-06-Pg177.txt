Statement on Negotiation of a Free Trade Agreement With South Korea

February 2, 2006

    The United States and the Republic of Korea have a strong alliance 
and are bound together by common values and a deep desire to expand 
freedom, peace, and prosperity throughout Asia and the world. Today we 
seek to deepen the ties between our nations by negotiating a 
comprehensive U.S.-Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement.
    A Free Trade Agreement with the Republic of Korea will provide 
important economic, political, and strategic benefits to both countries 
and build on America's engagement in Asia. The Republic of Korea is our 
seventh largest trading partner and seventh largest export market, and 
this Free Trade Agreement advances our commitment to opening markets and 
expanding opportunities for America's farmers, ranchers, workers, and 
businesses.
