Statement on House of Representatives Action on Scientific Research 
Legislation

June 29, 2006

    I commend the House for approving full funding of the basic research 
component of the American Competitiveness Initiative through the 
Science, State, Justice and Commerce appropriations bill. With this 
funding, the House has shown that it is committed to supporting the work 
of our Nation's most brilliant scientists as they study promising areas 
such as new energy technologies, supercomputing, and nanotechnology.
    I appreciate the support of Chairman Lewis and the tireless and 
effective efforts of Chairman Wolf, and I commend the House leadership's 
work to move quickly on the centerpiece of our innovation agenda. I urge 
the Senate to join the House in passing this important legislation.
