and patriot, Sonny Montgomery. Sonny Montgomery served during World War 
II and the Korean war, and he was a tireless advocate for America's 
veterans throughout his three decades in the House of Representatives. 
He sponsored the Montgomery GI Bill, which has helped make higher 
education and professional training accessible to millions of our 
veterans. In 2005, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 
Nation's highest civil award, in recognition of his lifetime of service 
to the United States. We send our condolences and prayers to the 
Montgomery family.
