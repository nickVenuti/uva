Statement on the National Economy

December 8, 2006

    Today we received a new report that confirms the continued strength 
of the American economy. The November jobs report showed that 132,000 
more Americans found work last month and that job creation in previous 
months was stronger than first estimated, adding 42,000 jobs to the 
numbers released last month. The unemployment rate remained low at 4.5 
percent. This is good news for American workers, and they are also 
seeing good news in their paychecks. As we look forward, our goal is to 
maintain the progrowth policies that have strengthened our economy and 
will stimulate the creation of good jobs and higher wages.
