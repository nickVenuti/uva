Statement on Senate Action on the ``Adam Walsh Child Protection and 
Safety Act of 2006''

July 21, 2006

    I applaud Members of the United States Senate for voting to 
strengthen our laws against convicted sex offenders.
    The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 will ensure 
appropriate sentencing for sex offenders and will provide local law 
enforcement officials with the tools they need to track those who prey 
upon children. By supporting this legislation, the Senate has taken an 
important step towards providing our country with a strict, uniform 
system for monitoring sex offenders to ensure that they do not commit 
additional crimes against our Nation's children.
    I urge the House of Representatives to pass this good legislation as 
quickly as possible, so that I can sign it into law.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 4472.
