Statement on the Death of James Brown

December 25, 2006

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of James Brown. For half a 
century, the innovative talent of the ``Godfather of Soul'' enriched our 
culture and influenced generations of musicians. An American original, 
his fans came from all walks of life and backgrounds. James Brown's 
family and friends are in our thoughts and prayers this Christmas.
