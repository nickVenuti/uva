Remarks on the Resignation of 
John R. Bolton as United States Permanent Representative to the United 
Nations

December 4, 2006

    The President. I received the resignation of Ambassador John Bolton. 
I accepted; I'm not happy about it. I think he deserved to be confirmed. 
And the reason why I think he deserved to be confirmed is because I know 
he did a fabulous job for the country.
    And I want to thank you and Gretchen for serving in a very important 
position, and doing so in a way that a lot of Americans really 
appreciate, John. We're going to miss you in this administration. You've 
been a stalwart defender of freedom and peace. You've been strong in 
your advocacy for human rights and human dignity. You've done everything 
that can be expected for an Ambassador.
    And I accept your letter, and I wish you and Gretchen all the very 
best.
    Ambassador Bolton. Many thanks.
    The President. Thank you. Thanks for serving.

Note: The President spoke at 3:49 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Gretchen Bolton, wife of 
Ambassador Bolton. The Office of the Press Secretary also made available 
Ambassador Bolton's letter of resignation.
