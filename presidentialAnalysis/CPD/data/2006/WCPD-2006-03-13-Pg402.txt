Remarks Prior to Discussions With Members of the Community in Islamabad

March 4, 2006

    Secretary Rice and Ambassador Crocker and I want to thank members 
from the civil society and members of Parliament for joining us. My trip 
to Pakistan is a really important trip. Pakistan is a strategic partner 
and a friend of the United States.
    I want to thank those of you who have come to share with me and the 
Secretary and the Ambassador, your thoughts about how the United States 
can better work with the people of Pakistan.
    One of the signs of a modern society is the empowerment of women. 
And I want to thank the women who have joined us here today to share 
your thoughts. And we've got the head of a bank; we've got a member of 
Parliament; we've got educators, heads of NGOs, businesspeople, that are 
all here to help us better understand the Pakistan society and how we 
can better interrelate.
    Part of becoming closer friends is to listen, listen to concerns and 
to share our thoughts on common values. So we really want to thank you 
for being here. And thank you for your gracious hospitality to your 
country.

Note: The President spoke at 3:25 p.m. at the U.S. Embassy.
