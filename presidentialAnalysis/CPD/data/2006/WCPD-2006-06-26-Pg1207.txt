Statement on Senate Action on Fisheries Management Legislation

June 21, 2006

    I applaud the Senate for passing a stronger Magnuson-Stevens Act by 
unanimous consent. By emphasizing the important role of ecosystem-based 
approaches to fisheries management and strengthening penalties for 
overfishing and other violations, this legislation will be vital to 
ensuring that we remain good stewards of our marine environment. I 
congratulate Chairman Stevens and Cochairman Inouye for their work on 
this important bipartisan bill that embraces my priorities of ending 
overfishing and rebuilding our Nation's fish stocks through more 
effective, market-based management methods.
    Since my administration released the Ocean Action Plan in 2004, we 
have been making great strides in our efforts to make our oceans, 
coasts, and lakes cleaner,

healthier, and more productive. Last week, I established the 
Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument, the largest 
single conservation area in the history of our country and the largest 
protected marine area in the world. Enactment of a stronger Magnuson-
Stevens Act is one of the top priorities of the Ocean Action Plan, and 
Senate passage of this bill is an important milestone on the way to 
another significant bipartisan ocean policy achievement.
    I urge the House of Representatives to join the Senate in passing 
this important initiative.
