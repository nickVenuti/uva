Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Spending-Reduction 
Legislation

February 1, 2006

    As I said last night, keeping America competitive requires us to be 
good stewards of taxpayer dollars. The House today passed a significant 
spending-reduction package that will curb the growth of entitlement 
spending for the first time in years and help us stay on track to cut 
the deficit in half by 2009. I look forward to signing this bill into 
law. The budget I propose next week will continue to build on the 
spending restraint we have achieved.

Note: The statement referred to S. 1932.
