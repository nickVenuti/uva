Remarks Following Discussions With President Nguyen Minh Triet of 
Vietnam in Hanoi

November 17, 2006

    Mr. President, thank you very much for your hospitality. Laura and I 
have been struck by the friendliness of the people of Vietnam. In our 
drive through this beautiful city, we were pleased to see thousands of 
your citizens with smiles on their faces. And we're so grateful.
    I've been reading and studying about your country, and I have seen 
now firsthand the great vibrancy and the excitement that's taking place 
in Vietnam. You're like a young tiger, and I look forward to continuing 
to work to make sure our bilateral relations are close. And thank you 
for hosting APEC. And thank you for hosting a dinner for us tonight. 
We're really looking forward to it.

Note: The President spoke at 2:35 p.m. at the Presidential Palace. A 
tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
