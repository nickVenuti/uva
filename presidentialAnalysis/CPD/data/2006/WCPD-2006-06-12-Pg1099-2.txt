Statement on Congressional Action on the ``Broadcast Decency Enforcement 
Act''

June 7, 2006

    I applaud the Congress for passing S. 193, the Broadcast Decency 
Enforcement Act. I believe that Government has a responsibility to help 
strengthen families. This legislation will make television and radio 
more family friendly by allowing the FCC to impose stiffer fines on 
broadcasters who air obscene or indecent programming. I look forward to 
signing this important legislation into law.
