Letter to Congressional Leaders on Extending Generalized System of 
Preferences Benefits to Liberia

February 22, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Liberia to the list 
of beneficiary developing countries and to the list of least-developed 
beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP). I have carefully considered the criteria identified 
in sections 501 and 502 of

the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. In light of these criteria, I have 
determined that it is appropriate to end the suspension of Liberia as a 
GSP beneficiary developing country and to extend least-developed 
beneficiary developing country benefits to Liberia.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
