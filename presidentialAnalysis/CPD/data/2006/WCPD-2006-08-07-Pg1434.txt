Statement on Cuba

August 3, 2006

    The United States is actively monitoring the situation in Cuba 
following the announcement of a transfer of power. At this time of 
uncertainty in Cuba, one thing is clear: The United States is absolutely 
committed to supporting the Cuban people's aspirations for democracy and 
freedom. We have repeatedly said that the Cuban people deserve to live 
in freedom. I encourage all democratic nations to unite in support of 
the right of the Cuban people to define a democratic future for their 
country. I urge the Cuban people to work for democratic change on the 
island. We will support you in your effort to build a transitional 
government in Cuba committed to democracy, and we will take note of 
those, in the current Cuban regime, who obstruct your desire for a free 
Cuba. In the event of a transition in the Cuban Government, we stand 
ready to provide humanitarian assistance as needed to help the Cuban 
people. It has long been the

hope of the United States to have a free, independent, and democratic 
Cuba as a close friend and neighbor. In achieving this, the Cuban people 
can count on the full and unconditional support of the United States.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
