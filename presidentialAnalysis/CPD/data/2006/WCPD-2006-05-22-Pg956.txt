Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Federal Budget

May 18, 2006

    The House's vote to pass a responsible budget marks a positive step 
toward controlling Federal spending. This Budget Resolution helps 
enforce spending discipline and moves us in the right direction to fund 
our Nation's key priorities. I congratulate Chairman Nussle, the House 
leadership, and all Members of the House who voted for this budget for 
their hard work and commitment to spending restraint.
