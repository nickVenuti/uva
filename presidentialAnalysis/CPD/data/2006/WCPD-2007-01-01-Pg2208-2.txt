Statement on the Death of Former President Gerald R. Ford

December 26, 2006

    Laura and I are greatly saddened by the passing of former President 
Gerald R. Ford.
    President Ford was a great American who gave many years of dedicated 
service to our country. On August 9, 1974, after a long career in the 
House of Representatives and service as Vice President, he assumed the 
Presidency in an hour of national turmoil and division. With his quiet 
integrity, common sense, and kind instincts, President Ford helped heal 
our land and restore public confidence in the Presidency.
    The American people will always admire Gerald Ford's devotion to 
duty, his personal character, and the honorable conduct of his 
administration. We mourn the loss of such a leader, and our 38th 
President will always have a special place in our Nation's memory. On 
behalf of all Americans, Laura and I offer our deepest sympathies to 
Betty Ford and all of President Ford's family. Our thoughts and prayers 
will be with them in the hours and days ahead.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
