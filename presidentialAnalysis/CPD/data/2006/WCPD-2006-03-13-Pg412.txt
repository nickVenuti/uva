Remarks on Election Day in Crawford, Texas

March 7, 2006

    The President. Thank you all.
    Q. Was it worth coming?
    The President. Yes, you bet. It's always good to come home to vote. 
And I urge all people to vote when given a chance. It's also good to be 
home in Texas--get a little rest here in my homestead and then heading 
over to New Orleans tomorrow and Mississippi.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 4:43 p.m. at the Crawford Fire Department.
