Statement on Congressional Passage of Fisheries Management Legislation

December 9, 2006

    I applaud Congress for working in a bipartisan manner to pass a 
stronger Magnuson-Stevens Act. Our Nation is committed to maintaining 
our thriving commercial and recreational fishing communities. This bill 
embraces my priorities of ending overfishing and rebuilding our Nation's 
fish stocks through more effective, market-based management and tougher 
enforcement. This landmark legislation also provides stronger tools to 
achieve progress internationally to ensure healthy fish stocks, promote 
better management, and halt destructive fishing practices based on sound 
science.

    Since my administration released the Ocean Action Plan in 2004, we 
have been making great strides in our efforts to make our oceans, 
coasts, and Great Lakes cleaner, healthier, and more productive. 
Enactment of this bill is one of the top priorities of the Ocean Action 
Plan and is another significant bipartisan environmental achievement.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 5946.
