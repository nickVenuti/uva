Statement on the Death of Milton Friedman

November 17, 2006

    America has lost one of its greatest citizens. Milton Friedman was a 
revolutionary thinker and extraordinary economist whose work helped 
advance human dignity and human freedom.
    A champion of limited government and personal freedom, Friedman 
proposed bold ideas about school choice, tax reductions, and an all-
volunteer army that serve as the foundation of many of America's most 
successful Government reforms. His work demonstrated that free markets 
are the great engines of economic development. His writings

laid the groundwork that transformed many of the world's central banks, 
helping deliver economic stability and improved living standards in 
countries around the world.
    Milton Friedman, a recipient of the Nobel Prize, will be remembered 
as one of the most influential economists in history. The Nation is 
grateful for his profound contributions.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with the Friedman family.
