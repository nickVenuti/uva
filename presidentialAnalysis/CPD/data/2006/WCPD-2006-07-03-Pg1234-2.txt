Statement on Senate Action on a Proposed Constitutional Amendment To 
Prohibit Desecration of the American Flag

June 27, 2006

    Today a bipartisan majority of United States Senators voted to 
protect our Nation's most important symbol through a Constitutional 
amendment to authorize Congress to prohibit the desecration of the 
American flag. Unfortunately, the final count fell short of the votes 
needed to send this important proposed amendment to the States for 
ratification.

    By showing respect for our flag, we show reverence for the ideals 
that guide our Nation and we show appreciation for the men and women who 
have served in defense of those ideals.
    I commend the Senators from both parties who voted to allow the 
amendment ratification process to protect our flag to go forward, and 
continue to believe that the American people deserve the opportunity to 
express their views on this important issue.

Note: The statement referred to S.J. Res. 12.
