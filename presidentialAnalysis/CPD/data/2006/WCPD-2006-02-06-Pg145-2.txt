Statement on Senate Confirmation of Ben S. Bernanke To Be Chairman of 
the Federal Reserve System

January 31, 2006

    I am pleased that the Senate has voted to confirm Ben Bernanke to be 
the next Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Ben is a man of impeccable 
credentials, sound policy judgment, and strong character--and he will 
make an outstanding Chairman. Ben has provided wise counsel and good 
advice as a member of my economic team, and he will serve our Nation 
with great distinction at the Federal Reserve.
    America's economy is strong for a lot of reasons, and one reason is 
the excellent work done by the men and women of the Federal Reserve. 
Under the leadership of Chairman Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve will 
continue to help provide Americans with a high quality of living.
