Mirage, California

April 23, 2006

    President Bush. It's such an honor to be with President and Mrs. 
Ford. The country has produced a lot of fine citizens, and there's no 
two finer people than these two. Thank you for your hospitality, sir.
    President Ford. We solved all the problems, didn't we? [Laughter]
    President Bush. That's right--we sure did.
    President Ford. Well, thank you for stopping by, George.
    President Bush. God bless you.
    President Ford. Same to you, sir.

Note: The President spoke at 6:01 p.m. at President Ford's residence.
