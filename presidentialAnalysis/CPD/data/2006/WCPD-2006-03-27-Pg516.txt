Message on the Observance of Nowruz

March 20, 2006

    I send greetings to those celebrating Nowruz.
    Nowruz is an ancient celebration marking the arrival of the New 
Year. For millions of people around the world who trace their heritage 
to Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Pakistan, India, and Central Asia, 
Nowruz is a celebration of life and an opportunity to express joy and 
happiness through visiting family and friends, exchanging gifts, and 
enjoying the beauty of nature.
    Our Nation is blessed by the traditions and contributions of 
Americans of many different backgrounds. Our diversity has made us 
stronger and better, and Laura and I send warm regards to all Americans 
celebrating Nowruz.
    Best wishes for peace and prosperity in the New Year.
