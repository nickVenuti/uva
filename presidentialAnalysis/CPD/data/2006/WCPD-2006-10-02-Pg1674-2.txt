Statement on the Death of Byron Nelson

September 26, 2006

    I was saddened to learn today of the passing of Byron Nelson. Byron 
Nelson was a legend in the game of golf, setting extraordinary standards 
for excellence on the course. More importantly, he was a true gentleman 
and role model for generations of golfers. Laura and I join fellow 
Texans and the sports world in extending our sympathies to his wife, 
Peggy, and his family and friends.
