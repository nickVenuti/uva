Remarks Following a Briefing on the War on Terror

April 25, 2006

    I want to thank the leadership of the United States Senate for 
joining me today. We have just been briefed from Baghdad about the 
formation of the unity Government. Not everybody around this table has 
agreed with certain aspects of this war on Iraq, but all of us agree 
that the formation of the unity Government is a very important moment in 
the history of a new Iraq.

    I want to thank the Members for their strong support of our 
diplomatic mission and the United States military, who are engaged in 
heroic efforts to help this young country succeed. We're on our way to 
victory.

    We've got more work to do. But the people--our troops need to know, 
and those working in the field need to know, there is a bipartisan 
desire for us to be successful in this very important theater in the war 
on terror.
    I want to thank you, Senators, for coming. I appreciate your time. 
Thank you for your interest in this vital subject.

Note: The President spoke at 12:24 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of
