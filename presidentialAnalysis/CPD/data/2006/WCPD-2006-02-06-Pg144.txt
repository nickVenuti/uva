Statement on the Death of Coretta Scott King

January 31, 2006

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Coretta Scott King. 
Mrs. King was a remarkable and courageous woman and a great civil rights 
leader. She carried on the legacy of her husband, Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., including through her extraordinary work at the King Center. 
Mrs. King's lasting contributions to freedom and equality have made 
America a better and more compassionate nation. Laura and I were 
fortunate to have known Mrs. King, and we will always treasure the time 
we spent with her. We send our condolences and prayers to the entire 
King family.
