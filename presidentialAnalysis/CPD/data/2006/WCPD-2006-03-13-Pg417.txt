Statement on a Proposed United States-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement

March 8, 2006

    The United States and Malaysia share strong trade and investment 
ties and a commitment to generating prosperity through openness, 
democracy, and freedom. Today we seek to further strengthen the ties 
between our two countries by launching negotiations on a comprehensive 
U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement.
    Once completed, a Free Trade Agreement with Malaysia will generate 
significant commercial, economic, political, and strategic benefits to 
both countries. It will improve our ties with the Southeast Asia region 
and strengthen our engagement in Asia. Malaysia is our tenth-largest 
trading partner, and the United States is Malaysia's second-largest 
source of imports. A U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement will advance our 
commitment to opening markets around the world and expanding 
opportunities for America's farmers, ranchers, workers, and businesses.
