Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Digital 
Computer Exports

February 3, 2006

Dear _____ <ratio>

    In accordance with the provisions of section 1211(d) of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105-85), I 
hereby notify you of my decision to establish a new level for the 
notification procedure for digital computers set forth in section 
1211(a) of Public Law 105-85. The new level will be 0.75 WT (Weighted 
TeraFLOPS). In accordance with the provisions of section 1211(e), I 
hereby notify you of my decision to remove Bulgaria from the list of 
countries covered under section 1211(b). The attached report provides 
the rationale supporting these decisions and fulfills the requirements 
of Public Law 105-85, sections 1211(d) and (e).
    I have made these changes based on the recommendation of the 
Departments of State, Defense, Commerce, and Energy.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to John W. Warner, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Armed Services; Richard C. Shelby, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; Duncan L. Hunter, 
chairman, House Committee on Armed Services; and Henry J. Hyde, 
chairman, House Committee on International Relations. This letter was 
released by the Office of the Press Secretary on February 6.
