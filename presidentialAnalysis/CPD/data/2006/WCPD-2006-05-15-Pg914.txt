Statement on Senate Action on Tax Legislation

May 11, 2006

    I applaud the Senate for passing important tax relief that will help 
keep our economy strong and growing. This legislation prevents an 
enormous tax hike that the American people do not want and would not 
welcome. The bill will extend policies that have helped our economy 
flourish. We have had 18 straight quarters of growth, including 4.8 
percent growth in the last quarter, and the unemployment rate is 4.7 
percent. I appreciate the Senate leadership and Chairman Grassley for 
their hard work on behalf of American taxpayers and small businesses, 
and I look forward to signing this important legislation into law.
