Statement on the Death of 
John J. ``Buck'' O'Neil

October 7, 2006

    Buck O'Neil represented the best of America's national pastime. He 
devoted his long and full life to baseball and refused to allow 
injustice and discrimination to diminish his love of the game and his 
joyous, generous spirit. Laura and I extend our sympathies to his family 
and friends, and on behalf of all Americans, we give thanks for the life 
of one of the great ambassadors in baseball history.
