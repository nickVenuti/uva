Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments for International Assistance Programs

June 27, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2007 Budget 
amendments for International Assistance Programs. The total 
discretionary budget authority in my FY 2007 Budget would not be 
increased by these requests.
    The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
