Statement on a Report of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba

July 10, 2006

    Today I approved the second report of the Commission for Assistance 
to a Free Cuba. I also approved a Compact with the People of Cuba, which 
outlines how the United States will support the Cuban people as they 
transition from the repressive control of the Castro regime to freedom 
and a genuine democracy. The report demonstrates that we are actively 
working for change in Cuba, not simply waiting for change. I call on all 
our democratic friends and allies around the world to join us in 
supporting freedom for the Cuban people. I applaud the work of the 
Commission, cochaired by Secretary Rice and Secretary Gutierrez.

Note: The statement referred to President Fidel Castro of Cuba. The 
Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
transcript of this statement.
