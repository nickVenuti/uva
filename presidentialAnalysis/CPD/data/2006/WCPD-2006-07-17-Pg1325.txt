Statement on the Terrorist Attacks on Commuter Trains in Mumbai, India

July 11, 2006

    On behalf of the American people, Laura and I send our deepest 
condolences to the friends and families of the victims of today's brutal 
attacks on commuter rail passengers in Mumbai. The United States stands 
with the people and the Government of India and condemns in the 
strongest terms these atrocities, which were committed against innocent 
people as they went about their daily lives. Such acts only strengthen 
the resolve of the international community to stand united against 
terrorism and to declare unequivocally that there is no justification 
for the vicious murder of innocent people.
