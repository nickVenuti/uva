Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency Regarding the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction

October 27, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the emergency posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
and their means of delivery declared by Executive Order 12938 on 
November 14, 1994, as amended, is to continue in effect beyond November 
14, 2006.
    Because the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the 
means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States, I have determined the national emergency previously 
declared must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2006.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
October 30.
