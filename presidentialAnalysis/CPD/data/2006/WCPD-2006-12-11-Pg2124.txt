Remarks Following a Meeting With Secretary of Defense-Designate Robert 
M. Gates

December 5, 2006

    The President. Good morning. I just had a breakfast with my nominee 
to be the Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates. Bob Gates will be a fine 
Secretary of Defense. I appreciate the fact that he's getting a hearing 
today in the United States Senate. I hope for a speedy confirmation so 
he can get sworn in and get to work.
    Those who wear the uniform know they'll have a friend in Bob Gates 
in the Defense Department. He admires our military; he respects those 
who have volunteered to serve our country. He's going to do an excellent 
job for us.
    Again, Bob, I thank you for agreeing to serve.
    Robert M. Gates. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much.
    The President. Best of luck up there on Capitol Hill. Good luck to 
you.
    Mr. Gates. Thank you.
    The President. Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 7:48 a.m. in the Diplomatic Reception Room 
at the White House.
