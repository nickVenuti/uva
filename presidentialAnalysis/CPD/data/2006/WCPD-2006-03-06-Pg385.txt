Statement on Senate Action To Renew the PATRIOT Act

March 2, 2006

    I applaud the Senate for voting to renew the PATRIOT Act and 
overcoming the partisan attempts to block its passage. The terrorists 
have not lost the will or the ability to attack us. The PATRIOT Act is 
vital to the war on terror and defending our citizens against a ruthless 
enemy. This bill will allow our law enforcement officials to continue to 
use the same tools against terrorists that are already used against drug 
dealers and other criminals, while safeguarding the civil liberties of 
the American people.
