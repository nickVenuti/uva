Statement on Congressional Passage of United States-India Nuclear Energy 
Cooperation Legislation

December 9, 2006

    Congress has agreed upon bipartisan legislation that will strengthen 
the strategic relationship between America and India and deliver 
valuable benefits to both nations. I am pleased that our two countries 
will soon have increased opportunities to work together to meet our 
energy needs in a manner that does not increase air pollution and 
greenhouse gas emissions, promotes clean development, supports 
nonproliferation, and advances our trade interests.
    I appreciate Congress's support for the U.S.-India civil nuclear 
cooperation initiative and would like to thank Chairman Hyde, Ranking 
Member Lantos, Chairman Lugar, and Ranking Member Biden for their 
leadership on this extraordinary legislation. I look forward to signing 
this bill into law soon.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 5682.
