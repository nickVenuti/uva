Remarks in a Discussion With Civic Leaders in Bogor, Indonesia

November 20, 2006

     Mr. President, thank you very much. Thank you all for joining. I'm 
really looking forward to this discussion. I admire Indonesia's 
pluralism and its diversity. I admire your President's commitment to 
reform and strengthening democracy. It's very important for the people 
of America to understand that this vast country has got not only 
tremendous potential, but it's got a prominent role to play in the 
world--showing how it's possible for people of good will to live 
together in peace and harmony. And that's the lesson I want to hear from 
you all as well. I'm looking forward to our discussion.
     I cannot thank you enough for taking time out of your busy day to 
come up here and share thoughts with us. I'm very interested in learning 
how our Government can continue to work with your Government as it so 
chooses, to help, particularly areas like education and health.
     And so with that, Mr. President, thank you very much for setting 
this up. I appreciate the opportunity to meet some of your fine 
citizens. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 5:35 p.m. at Bogor Palace. In his remarks, 
he referred to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia.
