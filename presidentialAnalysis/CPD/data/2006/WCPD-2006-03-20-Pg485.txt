Statement on House of Representatives Action on Supplemental Funding 
Legislation

March 16, 2006

    I applaud the House for its quick passage of legislation to provide 
vital resources for two of our Nation's top priorities. This bill will 
give our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan tools they need to prevail in 
the war on terror. The legislation also provides for additional 
resources for the people of the gulf coast as they continue the work of 
rebuilding their lives and communities. I urge the Senate to act 
promptly to pass legislation providing for these critical funds.
