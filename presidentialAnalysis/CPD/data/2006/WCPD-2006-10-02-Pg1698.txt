Statement on Congressional Action on the ``Department of Defense 
Appropriations Act, 2007''

September 29, 2006

    I applaud Congress for passing legislation that will provide our men 
and women in uniform with the necessary resources to protect our country 
and win the war on terror. As our troops risk their lives to fight 
terrorism, this bill will ensure they are prepared to defeat today's 
enemies and address tomorrow's threats. I look forward to signing this 
bill into law.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 5631.
