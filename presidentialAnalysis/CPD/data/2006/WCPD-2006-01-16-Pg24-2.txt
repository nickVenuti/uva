Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Notice of Intention To 
Enter Into a Free Trade Agreement With the Republic of Peru

January 6, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002, 
(Public Law 107-210; the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the 
Congress of my intention to enter into a free trade agreement with the 
Republic of Peru.
    The United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement will generate 
export opportunities for U.S. farmers, ranchers, and companies, help 
create jobs in the United States, and help American consumers save money 
while offering them more choices. The Agreement will also benefit the 
people of Peru by providing economic opportunity and by strengthening 
democracy.
    Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at 
least 90 days in advance of signing the Agreement. My Administration 
looks forward to working with the Congress in developing appropriate 
legislation to approve and implement this Agreement.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. This item was not received in time for publication in the
