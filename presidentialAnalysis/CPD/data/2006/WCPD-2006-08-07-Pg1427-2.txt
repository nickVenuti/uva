Remarks to Reporters at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, 
Maryland

August 1, 2006

    The President. I'm just amazed at the health care here at Bethesda. 
The Admiral runs an amazing operation. And it's really important for our 
citizens to know that if one of our men and women get hurt on the 
battlefield, they're going to get incredibly good health care.
    And, Admiral, I can't thank you and your staff enough for serving 
the country with great dignity and class.

    Rear Adm. Robinson. Thank you very much.
    The President. Appreciate being here. God bless. Thank you.
    I'm doing fine; my health is fine. I probably ate too many birthday 
cakes.

Note: The President spoke at 1:40 p.m. Participating in the visit was 
Rear Adm. Adam M. Robinson, Jr., USN, commander, National Naval Medical 
Center, and chief, Navy Medical Corps.
