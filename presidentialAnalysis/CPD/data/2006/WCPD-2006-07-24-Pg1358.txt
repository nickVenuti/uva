Statement on the Landing of the Space Shuttle Discovery

July 17, 2006

    On behalf of all Americans, I welcome home the crew of the Space 
Shuttle Discovery from a safe and successful mission. Your courage and 
commitment to excellence have inspired us all, and a proud Nation sends 
its congratulations on a job well done. The men and women of NASA have 
dedicated themselves to putting our space program back on track and 
implementing our Nation's vision for human and robotic space 
exploration. America's space program is a source of great national 
pride, and this mission has been another important accomplishment in 
advancing space science, human space flight, and space exploration.
