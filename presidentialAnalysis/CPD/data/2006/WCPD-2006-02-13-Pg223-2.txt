Statement on the Resignation of Claude Allen as Assistant to the 
President for Domestic Policy

February 9, 2006

    Claude Allen has been a trusted adviser since 2001. As Deputy 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, he worked hard to improve the 
health and welfare of all Americans. During the past year, he has served 
as my top domestic policy adviser at the White House and has helped 
develop policies that will strengthen our Nation's families, schools, 
and communities.

    Claude is a good and compassionate man, and he has my deep respect 
and my gratitude. I thank him for his many years of principled and 
dedicated service to our country. Laura and I wish Claude, Jann, and 
their family all the best.
