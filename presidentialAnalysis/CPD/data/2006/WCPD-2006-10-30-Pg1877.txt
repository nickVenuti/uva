Statement on the Retirement of Chief Usher Gary Walters

October 24, 2006

    Chief Usher Gary Walters has been a valued public servant to seven 
First Families for more than three decades at the White House. We have 
known Gary for many years and are especially grateful for making our 
family feel at home and for managing and overseeing the operations of 
the White House, a museum of American history. While we are sad to see 
him leave, we wish Gary all the best in his future endeavors.

Note: This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
as a statement by the President and the First Lady.
