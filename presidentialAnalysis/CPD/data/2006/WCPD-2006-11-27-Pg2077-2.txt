strong mother-to-child transmission program to prevent the children from 
developing HIV/AIDS.
    The doctor has been explaining to us their strategy on how to detect 
HIV/AIDS not only in the cities but in the provinces. And part of our 
comprehensive strategy to help this country is to distribute 
antiretroviral drugs.
    Laura and I have come by to thank the doctor and her staff for their 
compassionate work, and to assure the Vietnamese people that we will 
still help them fight HIV/AIDS.
