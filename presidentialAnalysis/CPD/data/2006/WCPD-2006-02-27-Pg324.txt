Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Consistent with the authorities relating to official immunity in the 
interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking (Public Law

informed, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration. This 
report addresses the matter of assistance for interdiction of aircraft 
engaged in illicit drug trafficking.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
