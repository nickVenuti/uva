Message on the Observance of Yom Kippur, 5767

September 28, 2006

    Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who 
keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his 
commandments, to a thousand generations . . .
                                               Deuteronomy 7:9
    On this most holy day of the Jewish calendar, Jews celebrate God's 
goodness and reflect on their lives. Yom Kippur is a solemn time to 
express thanksgiving that the Almighty remembers the names of all His 
children. During this blessed Day of Atonement, Jewish people gather in 
synagogues, consider their deeds and actions, and celebrate as the sound 
of the Shofar proclaims the forgiveness and mercy shown by the Creator 
of life.
    As the High Holy Days come to an end, the Jewish people in America 
and around the world remind us of the gift of religious freedom and the 
blessings of God's steadfast love. On Yom Kippur and throughout the 
year, your deep commitment to faith helps make the world a more hopeful 
and peaceful place.
    Laura and I send our best wishes for a blessed Yom Kippur.
                                                George W. Bush
