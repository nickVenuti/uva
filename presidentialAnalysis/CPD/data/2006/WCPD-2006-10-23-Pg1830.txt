Remarks on the United Nations Security Council Resolution on North Korea

October 14, 2006

    Today the United Nations Security Council passed a unanimous 
resolution, sending a clear message to the leader of North Korea 
regarding his weapons programs. This action by the United Nations, which 
was swift and tough, says that we are united in our determination to see 
to it that the Korean Peninsula is nuclear-weapons free.
    I have said all along there is a better way forward for North Korea. 
There's a better way forward for the people of North Korea. If the 
leader of North Korea were to verifiably end his weapons programs, the 
United States and other nations would be willing to help the nation 
recover economically.
    The message today, however, says to the leader of North Korea that 
the world is united in our opposition to his nuclear weapons plans.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 3:30 p.m. on the South Grounds at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Chairman Kim Jong Il of North 
Korea. He also referred to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1718.
