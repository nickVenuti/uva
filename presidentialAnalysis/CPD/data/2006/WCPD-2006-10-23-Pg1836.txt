Statement on Signing the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage 
Wilderness Act

October 17, 2006

    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 233, the ``Northern California 
Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act.'' The Act strengthens protection 
of certain lands in California.

    Section 4(i)(2) of the Act purports to give binding legal effect to 
guidelines in an appendix to a report issued by a congressional 
committee, which was not incorporated into the Act and for which 
presentment was not made. Consistent with the bicameral approval and 
presentment requirements of the Constitution for the making of a law, 
the executive branch shall, in carrying out the Act, take appropriate 
account of the guidelines as a matter of comity between the executive 
and legislative branches.
                                                George W. Bush

 The White House,
 October 17, 2006.

Note: H.R. 233, approved October 17, was assigned Public Law No. 109-
362.
