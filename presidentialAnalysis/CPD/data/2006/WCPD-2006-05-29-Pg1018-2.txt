Statement on Senate Passage of Immigration Reform Legislation

May 25, 2006

temporary-worker program to take pressure off our border and meet the 
needs of our growing economy, address the issue of the millions of 
illegal immigrants already in our country, and honor America's great 
tradition of the melting pot. The House of Representatives began a 
national dialog by passing an immigration bill last year. Now that the 
Senate has acted, I look forward to working together with both the House 
of Representatives and the Senate to produce a bill for me to sign into 
law.
