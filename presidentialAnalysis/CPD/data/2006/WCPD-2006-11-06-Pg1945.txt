Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Sudan

November 1, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the Sudan emergency is to continue in effect beyond November 3, 2006.
    The crisis constituted by the actions and policies of the Government 
of Sudan that led to the declaration of a national emergency on November 
3, 1997, and the expansion of that emergency on April 26, 2006, has not 
been resolved. These actions and policies are hostile to U.S. interests 
and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, I have 
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and 
to maintain sanctions against Sudan.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
