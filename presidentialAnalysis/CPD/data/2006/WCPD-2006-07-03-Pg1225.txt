Statement Marking 10 Years After Attack on Khobar Towers

June 26, 2006

    Ten years ago yesterday, in an attack on the Khobar Towers apartment 
complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 19 members of our Armed Forces were 
killed and hundreds of other Americans were injured by terrorists who we 
believe were working with Iranian officials. We honor the courage of 
those who paid the ultimate price in defending our country. America will 
carry on the legacy of these fallen heroes by continuing the mission for 
which they gave their lives: defeating tyranny, defending freedom, and 
protecting their fellow citizens.
    Laura and I offer our prayers and the gratitude of this great Nation 
to the families who lost loved ones in that brutal attack. These 
families can know that their loved ones will always be remembered and 
that we will remain determined in our efforts to bring to justice those 
responsible for this attack.
    In remembrance of those who lost their lives ten years ago, I ask 
Americans to keep their families in your hearts and your prayers.
