Memorandum on the 2006 Combined Federal Campaign

September 13, 2006

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: 2006 Combined Federal Campaign

    Admiral Thad W. Allen, Commandant of the United States Coast Guard, 
has agreed to serve as the Chair of the 2006 Combined Federal Campaign 
of the National Capital Area. I ask you to enthusiastically support the 
CFC by personally chairing the campaign in your agency and by 
encouraging top agency officials around the country to do the same.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. Public servants not 
only contribute to the campaign but also assume leadership roles to 
ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help positively influence 
thousands of employees and will guarantee another successful campaign.
                                                George W. Bush
