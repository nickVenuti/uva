Statement on the Death of Lee Jong-wook

May 22, 2006

    Laura and I were saddened to learn of the death of Dr. Lee Jong-
wook. As the world's top health official, Dr. Lee worked tirelessly to 
improve the health of millions of people, from combating tuberculosis 
and HIV/AIDS to his aggressive efforts to eradicate polio. He provided 
tremendous leadership to the international community as it confronted 
the challenges of the 21st century, including the threat of an influenza 
pandemic. Dr. Lee's outreach to world leaders and entities increased 
awareness of potentially devastating public health dangers. We send our 
deepest condolences to his family.
