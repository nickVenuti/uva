Statement on the Death of Eusebio Penalver Mazorra

May 13, 2006

    Eusebio Penalver Mazorra was a Cuban patriot who spent 28 years in 
Castro's prisons. His resistance to tyranny is a testament to the moral 
courage of all Cubans who desire to see freedom return to their 
beautiful island nation. Laura joins me in sending our thoughts and 
prayers to his family and friends.
