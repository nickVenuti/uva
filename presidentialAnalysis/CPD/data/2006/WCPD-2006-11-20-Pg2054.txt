Statement on the Upcoming State Visit of Queen Elizabeth II of England 
and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh

November 15, 2006

    Laura and I welcome Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal 
Highness Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh, for a state visit in May 
2007 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement. The 
United States and the United Kingdom enjoy an extraordinary friendship 
that is sustained by deep historical and cultural ties and a commitment 
to defend freedom around the world. We look forward to Her Majesty's 
state visit as an occasion to celebrate these enduring bonds.
