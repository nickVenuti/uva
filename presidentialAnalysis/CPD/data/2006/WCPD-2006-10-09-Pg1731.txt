Remarks on Arrival in Los Angeles, California

California Wildfires

    Thank you all very much for talking on Air Force One. We had a 
briefing on the fires that have been ravaging country here in 
California. I was proud to be here with the U.S. Forest Service--as you 
can see, one of the yellow shirts. These are the people on the frontline 
of fighting these fires.
    And they brought me up to date, particularly on the Day Fire. And 
that fire has been contained, which is good news for the people

of California. I congratulate the Forest Service for their planning and 
operational planning on fighting this fire.
    I really want to thank the brave firefighters who risk their lives 
on a daily basis to contain the fires. I was briefed on the Healthy 
Forest Initiative, particularly in the urban interface and was pleased 
to hear we're making progress on helping to contain fires once they 
start. We've got a lot more work to do. I believe Congress needs to pass 
further law that will enable us to restore forests once they've been 
burned.
    But all in all, it's been a good lesson for us to watch these Forest 
Service people do their job, and I'm really proud of them. I want to 
thank you for joining me, and I congratulate you for your good work.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 4:52 p.m. at the Los Angeles International 
Airport. A tape was not available for verification of the content of
