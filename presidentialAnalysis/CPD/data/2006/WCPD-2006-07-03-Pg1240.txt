Statement on Senate Confirmation of Henry M. Paulson, Jr., as Secretary 
of the Treasury

June 28, 2006

    I commend the Senate for moving swiftly to confirm Henry Paulson as 
Secretary of the Treasury. I look forward to working with Hank to keep 
our economy and financial markets strong, and to continue our efforts to 
choke off sources of terrorist financing. I thank Chairman Grassley, 
Senator Baucus, and Senator Schumer for their leadership during the 
confirmation process. I congratulate Hank and his family on his 
confirmation and thank him for his service to our Nation.
