Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I 
hereby certify that the export to the People's Republic of China of the 
following items are not detrimental to the U.S. space launch industry 
and that the material and equipment, including any indirect technical 
benefit that could be derived from such exports, will not measurably 
improve the missile or space launch capabilities of the People's 
Republic of China:
 <bullet>    110,000 pounds of fine grain bulk graphite to be 
            distributed to seven companies in the People's Republic of 
            China for machining into industrial components; and
 <bullet>    A motorized mixer with a stainless steel vacuum mixing tank 
            to Dow Corning (Shanghai) Company in the People's Republic 
            of China.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
