Remarks Following a Meeting With the Iraq Study Group

June 14, 2006

    I want to thank a distinguished group of Americans, led by Jim Baker 
and Lee Hamilton, for your willingness to look at the way forward in 
Iraq and to provide advice to the administration, to the Congress, and 
to the American people about the proper strategies and tactics to 
achieve success.
    Iraq is a complex situation. It is vital that we succeed. And the 
fact that you all are willing to lend your expertise to help chart the 
way forward means a lot. And I can't thank you enough. We've got 
Republicans at the table; we've got Democrats at the table; we've got 
people who've served in the administration, administrations past, our 
court system, and the legislative branch. And you bring a lot of 
expertise and a lot of knowledge, and the fact that you're willing to 
lend your expertise and knowledge to help our country means a lot.
    Once again, you've been called to serve, and once again, you are 
serving, and we thank you for that a lot. Appreciate you very much.
