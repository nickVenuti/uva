Statement on the Report of the Commission on the Future of Higher 
Education

September 26, 2006

    Today Education Secretary Margaret Spellings released the report of 
a commission whose focus was to help make America's higher education 
system more affordable and more accessible and to provide parents and 
students with information that will help them make better-informed 
choices. I strongly support the thrust of this important report and look 
forward to working with Secretary Spellings, the higher education 
community, the Congress, and the States to ensure that our higher 
education system remains the finest in the world.

    America's colleges and universities have always played an important 
role in advancing innovation, opportunity, and prosperity throughout our 
Nation and the world. We must all work to provide our students with the 
knowledge and skills they need to shape a hopeful future for our 
country.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
transcript of this statement.
