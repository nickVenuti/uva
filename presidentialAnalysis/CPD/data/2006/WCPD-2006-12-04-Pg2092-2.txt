Statement on the Death of Police Officer Steve Favela

November 26, 2006

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Officer Steve Favela 
of the Honolulu Police Department. Officer Favela died from injuries he 
suffered while protecting us during our visit to Hawaii. We send our 
condolences to his wife, Barbara, his entire family, and his fellow law 
enforcement officers. We pray that God will comfort them and that their 
friends and loved ones will sustain them in this difficult time.

    Officer Favela risked his life every day to protect the people of 
his community. In this time of great sadness, we give thanks for his 
life of service.
