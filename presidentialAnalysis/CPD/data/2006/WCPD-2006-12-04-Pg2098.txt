Remarks at a Lunch Hosted by President Toomas Ilves of Estonia in 
Tallinn

November 28, 2006

    Mr. President, thank you very much, and, Mr. Prime Minister, thank 
you as well for your gracious hospitality. I'm really thrilled to be 
here in Estonia. I love being in a country that values liberty and 
freedom. I appreciate being in a country that understands there are 
duties and obligations beyond her border to help others realize the 
benefits of liberty and freedom. I'm very proud of your military, and 
I'm pleased to be in the presence of those who wear the uniform of 
Estonia. I know our military has great respect for the Estonian 
soldiers.
    I am amazed to be in a country that has been able to effect a flat 
tax in such a positive way. I am impressed by the e-governance that you 
have here in Estonia.
    All in all, this has been a very worthwhile and exciting visit for 
me, and I thank you for your warm hospitality. And I'd like to raise my 
glass to the leadership of this important country, to our friendship, 
and most importantly, to the people of Estonia.
