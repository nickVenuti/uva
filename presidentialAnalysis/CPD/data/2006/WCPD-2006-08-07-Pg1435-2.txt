Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations

August 3, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the emergency caused by the lapse of the 
Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, is to continue in effect 
for 1 year beyond August 17, 2006, to the Federal Register for 
publication.
    Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
