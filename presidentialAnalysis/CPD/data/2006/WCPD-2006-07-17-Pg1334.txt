Statement Honoring Former President Gerald Ford's Birthday

July 14, 2006

    President Gerald Ford's story is a true American story. It is the 
tale of a son of the Midwest who achieved great things through hard 
work, dedication, courage, and humility. President Ford played football 
at Michigan, received a law degree from Yale, served in the Navy during 
World War II, and for decades he represented western Michigan as a 
Republican Congressman from Grand Rapids.
    Then came his appointment with history. He assumed the Presidency at 
a perilous moment for our country. A President had resigned; the United 
States was involved in a cold war; the economy was sputtering; and 
America's confidence was deeply shaken.
    Few leaders have ever faced such challenges upon taking office. Yet 
President Ford met them with steadfastness and courage. His leadership 
helped heal a wounded nation.
    Since leaving office, President Ford has set a high standard for 
grace and character. He has never forgotten his roots or lost sight of 
the things that matter--including his deep love for his wife and 
partner, Betty.
    Laura and I join all Americans in wishing President Ford a happy 
birthday.
