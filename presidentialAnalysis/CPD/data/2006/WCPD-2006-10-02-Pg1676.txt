Statement on House of Representatives Action on the ``Military 
Commissions Act of 2006''

September 27, 2006

    Earlier this month, I discussed with the American people a CIA 
program that has proven to be one of our most effective tools in the war 
on terror. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained 
and questioned about threats against our country. Because a Supreme 
Court decision put the future of this program in question, I asked 
Congress to provide legislation to save this important tool.
    Today the House passed legislation that would allow this vital 
program to continue and help keep our country safe. The Military 
Commissions Act of 2006 addresses the Supreme Court's ruling regarding 
the application of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and 
clarifies the standards for U.S. personnel who detain and question 
unlawful enemy combatants. The act also creates a comprehensive 
statutory structure for

military commissions so that we can prosecute suspected terrorists.
    I appreciate the House's commitment to strengthening our national 
security. I urge the Senate to act quickly to get a bill to my desk 
before Congress adjourns.
