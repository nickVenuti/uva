Remarks to Reporters Following a Visit to the National Archives and 
Records Administration

January 16, 2006

    It seems fitting on Martin Luther King Day that I come and look at 
the Emancipation Proclamation in its original form. Abraham Lincoln 
recognized that all men are created equal. Martin Luther King lived on 
that admonition to call our country to a higher calling, and today we 
celebrate the life of an American who called Americans to account when 
we didn't live up to our ideals.
    Allen, thanks for having me. I would strongly recommend our fellow 
citizens come to this house of archives--a house that archives a lot of 
our important documents. It's really an amazing place; it's really 
fascinating. I appreciate you and your staff, thanking you.
    All right, thank you all. See you later today.

Note: The President spoke at 9 a.m. in the East Rotunda Gallery. In his 
remarks, he referred to Archivist of the United States Allen Weinstein.
