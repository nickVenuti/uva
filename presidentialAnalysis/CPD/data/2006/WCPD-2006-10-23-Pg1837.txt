Statement on the Population of the United States Reaching 300 Million

October 17, 2006

    For more than two centuries, America has been a beacon of hope and 
opportunity for people around the world, millions of whom came here to 
live in freedom and make better lives for themselves and their families. 
Today we celebrate a significant milestone--the population of the United 
States has now reached 300 million. Our continued growth is a testament 
to our country's dynamism and a reminder that America's greatest asset 
is our people.
    America is built on a shared love of freedom and a belief in the 
dignity and matchless value of every human being. Our confidence in our 
people has carried us to ever greater achievements in all areas of human 
endeavor and allowed us to remain the world's most vibrant and 
innovative country. And so long as we insist on high standards in 
education, place our trust in the talents and ingenuity of ordinary 
Americans, and protect our freedoms, we will remain the land of 
opportunity for generations to come. We welcome this milestone as 
further proof that the American Dream remains as bright and hopeful as 
ever.
