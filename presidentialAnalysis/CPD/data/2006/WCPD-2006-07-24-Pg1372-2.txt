Statement on House of Representatives Approval of a Free Trade Agreement 
With Oman

July 20, 2006

    I am pleased the House has approved our free trade agreement with 
Oman. This agreement will advance America's national security by 
strengthening our bilateral relations with a strategic friend and ally 
in the Middle East region. The agreement will also level the playing 
field for U.S. workers and businesses, and will support Oman's leaders 
as they seek to create long-term opportunities for the Omani people. I 
look forward to signing this legislation and to continuing our efforts 
to build a Middle East Free Trade Area.
