Remarks on Immigration Reform Legislation in Charlotte, North Carolina

April 6, 2006

    I'm pleased that Republicans and Democrats in the United States 
Senate are working together to get a bipartisan comprehensive energy 
bill--let me start over. I'm pleased that Republicans and Democrats in 
the United States Senate are working together to get a comprehensive 
immigration bill.
    I want to thank the efforts of those involved in the process. I 
appreciate their understanding there needs to be a comprehensive 
immigration bill. I recognize there are still details to be worked out. 
I would encourage the Members to work hard to get the bill done prior to 
the upcoming break.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 12:36 p.m. at the North Carolina Air 
National Guard base at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport.
