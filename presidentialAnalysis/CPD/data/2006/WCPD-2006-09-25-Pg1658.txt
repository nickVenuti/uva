Statement on Senate Confirmation of Kenneth Wainstein To Be Assistant 
Attorney General for National Security at the Department of Justice

September 22, 2006

    I am pleased the Senate has confirmed Kenneth Wainstein as the first 
Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Department of 
Justice. As head of this new division, Ken will bring together our 
national security, counterterrorism, counterespionage, and foreign 
intelligence surveillance litigation under one Assistant Attorney 
General. Ken is an effective leader, who will play an important role in 
our efforts to combat terrorism.
    Ken's confirmation fulfills one of the critical recommendations of 
the WMD Commission and further strengthens our ability to protect all 
Americans.
    I urge the Senate to give all my nominees a prompt up-or-down vote.
