Remarks Following a Dinner With Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and 
Business Leaders in Chicago, Illinois

July 6, 2006

    Laura said, ``What do you want for your birthday?'' I said, ``I want 
to have dinner in Chicago with the mayor.'' [Laughter] Thank you all for 
joining us. We've had a wonderful discussion. Chicago is a fabulous 
town, Mayor. And you're awfully kind to host us here.
    Somebody said, ``Well, what's your birthday wish?'' I've got a lot 
of birthday wishes. I hope our troops are safe. I hope Roger Ebert does 
well. That's a birthday wish. I know a lot of people here in Chicago are 
praying for him. It's been a heck of a birthday party tonight, and I 
appreciate you all joining me, and looking forward to having my cake.
    Thanks for coming.

Note: The President spoke at 8:21 p.m. in the Chicago Firehouse 
Restaurant. In his remarks, he referred to Chicago Sun-Times film critic 
Roger Ebert who had emergency surgery on July 2. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of these remarks.
