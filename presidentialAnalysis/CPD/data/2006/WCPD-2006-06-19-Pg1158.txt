Statement on Congressional Action on Appropriations Legislation

June 15, 2006

    I applaud those Members of Congress who came together in a fiscally 
responsible way to provide much-needed funds for the war on terror and 
continued Hurricane Katrina recovery, as well as for securing our border 
and protecting against a possible avian flu pandemic. Responding to 
these critical needs in a timely way is not easy, but it must be done if 
we are to fight terrorism, defend our homeland, enforce our borders, and 
fulfill our moral obligation to help our fellow Americans in need. I am 
pleased that Congress has addressed these urgent national priorities 
within the spending limits I set. House and Senate Leadership and 
Chairmen Cochran and Lewis deserve great credit for working together to 
pass a fiscally responsible bill.
