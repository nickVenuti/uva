Statement on Senate Action on the ``Military Commissions Act of 2006''

September 28, 2006

    Today the Senate sent a strong signal to the terrorists that we will 
continue using every element of national power to pursue our enemies and 
to prevent attacks on America. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 will 
allow the continuation of a CIA program that has been one of America's 
most potent tools in fighting the war on terror. Under this program, 
suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats 
against our country. Information we have learned from the program has 
helped save lives at home and abroad. By authorizing the creation of 
military commissions, the act will also allow us to prosecute suspected 
terrorists for war crimes.
    Our most solemn responsibility is protecting America's security, and 
I thank the Senate for passing this vital legislation.

Note: The statement referred to S. 3930.
