Remarks Following a Meeting With Religious Leaders in New Delhi

March 2, 2006

    The President. We have just had a--a very important discussion about 
the role of religion, not only in India but the role that religion can 
play in helping the world become a more peaceful place. I want to thank 
the leaders here around the table. Leaders from different faiths have 
joined us to share with--their thoughts with me.

    You know, one of the things that struck me during the conversation 
is, in India, is--it's a country that recognizes the importance of 
religion and welcomes interfaith dialog, understands the importance of 
faith and understands the importance of people of faith discussing 
thoughts and views that are--that are deep in their hearts.

    And we've had a--just a--you know, India is an amazing country. Just 
look around the table, and you'll see different religions represented. 
But everybody around the table also was so proud to be in India. In 
other words, their nationalism was equally important then, as their 
religion.
    We thank the----
    Acharya Srivatsa Goswami. ----here to the world.
    The President. Well, that's right. That's right. Thank you. Anyway, 
I just appreciate you all coming. Thank you for your kind words, and 
like you, I hope for peace, and like you, I'm proud to be here in India. 
It's a fantastic country.
    Thank you.
