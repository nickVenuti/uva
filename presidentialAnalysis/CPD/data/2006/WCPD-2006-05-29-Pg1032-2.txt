Statement on Senate Confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh To Be a United 
States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia

May 26, 2006

    I applaud the Senate's vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Brett Kavanaugh 
is superbly qualified for the Court of Appeals and will be a brilliant, 
thoughtful, and fair-minded judge. I appreciate his distinguished 
service in the executive branch for the last 5 years, as Associate 
Counsel and then Senior Associate Counsel to the President, and since 
July 2003 in the vital role of Staff Secretary. I congratulate Brett and 
his family on today's confirmation and thank him for his continued 
service to the law and our Nation.
