Trade

April 27, 2006

    I am pleased that the United States and Canada concluded a framework 
agreement

today to resolve the long-standing dispute on softwood lumber trade. 
This agreement shows how NAFTA partners can overcome differences and 
work together. The United States' close ties with our good friend and 
northern neighbor made this agreement possible. I applaud Prime Minister 
Harper's leadership in resolving this issue, and I am grateful to the 
lead negotiators on both sides, Ambassador Susan C. Schwab for the 
United States and Ambassador Michael Wilson of Canada.
