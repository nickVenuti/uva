Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on the 37th Anniversary of the Supreme Court Decision in Roe v. Wade January 22, 2010 Today we recognize the 37th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which affirms every woman's fundamental constitutional right to choose whether to have an abortion, as well as each American's right to privacy from Government intrusion. I have and continue to support these constitutional rights. I also remain committed to working with people of good will to prevent unintended pregnancies, support pregnant women and families, and strengthen the adoption system. Today and every day, we must strive to ensure that all women have limitless opportunities to fulfill their dreams. Categories: Statements by the President : Roe v.
