Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on Senate Passage of Small-Business Jobs Legislation September 23, 2010 The small-business jobs bill passed today will help provide loans and cut taxes for millions of small-business owners without adding a dime to our Nation's deficit. After months of partisan obstruction and needless delay, I'm grateful that Democrats and a few Republicans came together to support this commonsense plan to put Americans back to work. I look forward to signing the bill on Monday. NOTE: The statement referred to H.R. 5297. Categories: Statements by the President : Small-business jobs legislation, Senate passage.
