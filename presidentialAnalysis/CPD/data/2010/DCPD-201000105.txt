Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on the Settlement of the Pigford Class-Action Lawsuit on Discrimination by the Department of Agriculture February 18, 2010 My administration is dedicated to ensuring that Federal agencies treat all our citizens fairly, and the settlement in the Pigford case reflects that commitment. I applaud Secretary Vilsack for his efforts to modernize operations at the USDA, as well as the work of the Justice Department in bringing these long-ignored claims of African American farmers to a rightful conclusion. I look forward to a swift resolution to this issue, so that the families affected can move on with their lives.
