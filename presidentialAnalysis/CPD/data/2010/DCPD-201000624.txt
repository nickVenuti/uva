Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on Signing the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2010 July 22, 2010  Today I signed the unemployment insurance extension to restore desperately needed assistance to 2½   million Americans who lost their jobs in the recession. After a partisan minority used procedural tactics to block the authorization of this assistance three separate times over the past weeks, Americans who are fighting to find a good job and support their families will finally get the support they need to get back on their feet during these tough economic times. Now it's time for Congress to act on more proposals that support our economic recovery, including passing critical aid to our States and support to small businesses. Small businesses are the engine of job growth, and measures to cut their taxes and make lending available should not be held hostage to partisan tactics like those that unconscionably held up unemployment insurance. NOTE: H.R. 4213, approved July 22, was assigned Public Law No. 111–205. Categories: Bill Signings and Vetoes : Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2010, statement.
