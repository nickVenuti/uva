Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on the Flooding in the Southeast May 4, 2010 Our thoughts and prayers are with every American who has been impacted by the severe weather and flooding in the southeast, and our deepest condolences go out to those who have lost loved ones. I would also like to extend my gratitude to the local first-responders who have been working tirelessly to save lives and protect property in the face of these devastating storms. I have spoken with the Governors in the most severely impacted States, and yesterday I dispatched FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate to Tennessee to view the flood damage firsthand and to report back on any unmet needs. Federal officials have been dispatched to the region, and we will continue working in close coordination with State and local officials to support response and recovery efforts.
