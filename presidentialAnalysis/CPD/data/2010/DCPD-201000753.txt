Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on Senate Action on Small-Business Legislation September 14, 2010 Today's vote brings us one step closer to ending the months-long partisan blockade of a small-business jobs bill that was written by both Democrats and Republicans. This is a bill that would cut taxes and help provide loans to millions of small-business owners, who create most of the new jobs in this country. It is fully paid for, it won't add to the deficit, and small businesses across the country have been waiting for Washington to act on this bill for far too long. I am grateful to Senators Reid, Baucus, and Landrieu for their leadership on this issue, as well as the two Republican Senators who put partisanship aside and joined Democrats in overcoming this filibuster. I urge all Members of the Senate to support final passage as soon as possible. NOTE: In his statement, he referred to Sens. George V. Voinovich and George S. LeMieux. He also referred to H.R. 5297.
