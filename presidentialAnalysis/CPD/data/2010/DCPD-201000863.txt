Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on the Death of Albertina Walker October 10, 2010 Michelle and I are saddened by the passing of Gospel great Albertina Walker. Ms. Walker was known for her Grammy Award winning voice and recognized by many as the Queen of Gospel. Growing up on the south side of Chicago, she started singing in her church youth choir at just 4 years old, where she learned to spread the Good News through song. She also performed before President Bill Clinton and was honored at the White House by President George W. Bush for her contributions to Gospel music. And she never forgot to give back, impacting her community through the Albertina Walker Scholarship Fund and many other charitable endeavors. Ms. Walker's voice and message has touched congregations across the Nation. Though we have lost an American icon, her influence on Gospel music will continue for generations. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and the countless lives she touched. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Walker, Albertina.
