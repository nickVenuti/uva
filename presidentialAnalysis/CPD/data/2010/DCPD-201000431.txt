Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates's Efforts to Reform Department of Defense Spending May 28, 2010 As the Congress continues its work on funding bills for the Department of Defense, I want to reiterate my strong support for the reforms Secretary Gates is advancing at the Pentagon. He has kept me fully apprised of his efforts to reform how our military operates and bring needed efficiencies to the Department of Defense. I stand squarely behind Secretary Gates's position on the JSF second engine and Câ€“17 programs. As the statement of administration policy made clear, our military does not want or need these programs being pushed by the Congress, and should Congress ignore this fact, I will veto any such legislation so that it can be returned to me without those provisions.
