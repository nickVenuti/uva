Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on the Resignation of Edward B. Montgomery as Director of Recovery for Auto Communities and Workers June 14, 2010 I want to thank Dr. Ed Montgomery for his dedicated service to my administration and the country. Over the last year, Ed has crisscrossed the country in a tireless effort to cut through redtape and speed the economic recovery for those hit hardest by the auto industry's struggles. The results of his efforts have been felt in auto towns across America, from the factories being put back to use years ahead of schedule to the workers retraining for jobs in emerging industries.  While Ed will be missed, my administration's commitment to autoworkers and communities remains strong. The work of the White House Council on Auto Communities will continue under the direction of Secretary Solis and NEC Director Larry Summers, and we will move quickly to find a replacement for Dr. Montgomery.
