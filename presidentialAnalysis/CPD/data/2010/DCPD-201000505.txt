Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a Budget Amendment for Fiscal Year 2011 June 16, 2010 Dear Madam Speaker: On May 21, 2010, I signed Executive Order 13543 establishing the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling to provide for a comprehensive look at how the oil and gas industry operates and how we regulate it. The purpose of this Commission is to examine both the relevant facts and circumstances concerning the causes of the disaster and to develop options for safety and environmental precautions necessary to prevent a similar disaster from happening again. This is why I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendment to Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 proposals in my FY 2011 Budget. This request responds to urgent and essential needs. Therefore, I request this proposal be considered as an emergency requirement. The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Sincerely, BARACK OBAMA Categories: Communications to Congress : Budget amendment for fiscal year 2011, letter transmitting.
