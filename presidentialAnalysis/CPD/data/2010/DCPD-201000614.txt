Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on Senate Judiciary Committee Vote on Supreme Court Associate Justice-Designate Elena Kagan July 20, 2010 Elena Kagan is one of this country's leading legal minds and has shown throughout this process that, if confirmed, she would be a fair and impartial Supreme Court Justice who understands how decisions made by the Court affect the lives of everyday Americans. Today's vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee is a bipartisan affirmation of her strong performance during her confirmation hearings. I want to thank the Judiciary Committee for giving her a thorough, timely, and respectful hearing, and I look forward to the full Senate taking up and voting on this nomination before the August recess.
