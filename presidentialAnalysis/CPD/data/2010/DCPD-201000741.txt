Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Certain Terrorist Attacks September 10, 2010 Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register the enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to the terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001, is to continue in effect for an additional year. The terrorist threat that led to the declaration on September 14, 2001, of a national emergency continues. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue in effect after September 14, 2010, the national emergency with respect to the terrorist threat. Sincerely, BARACK OBAMA NOTE: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Joe Biden, President of the Senate.
