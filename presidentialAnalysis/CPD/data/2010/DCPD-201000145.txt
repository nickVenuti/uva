Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on Senate Passage of Legislation Temporarily Extending Various Programs Including Unemployment Insurance March 2, 2010 During these difficult economic times, supporting American workers, their families, and our small businesses must be everyone's focus. The bill passed tonight by the Senate will extend access to health care benefits for workers who have lost their jobs, help small businesses get loans so they can grow and hire, and extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of Americans who are looking for work. I'm grateful to the Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle who worked to end this roadblock to relief for America's working families.
