Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on House Energy and Commerce Committee Passage of HOMESTAR Legislation April 15, 2010 Today's bipartisan committee vote is an important step forward in our effort to create jobs, save consumers money, and increase energy efficiency. In my State of the Union Address and in the months since, I have called on Congress to pass a program of incentives to homeowners who make their homes more energy efficient. The HOMESTAR legislation approved today would do just that, providing consumers with upfront rebates on investments in things like insulation, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and windows that have been proven to save energy. This proposal is not a Democratic or Republican idea, it's a commonsense strategy to help put Americans back to work while giving American consumers a break. I want to thank the Members of Congress from both parties that have worked to support this legislation, as well as their colleagues in the Senate who are working to promote HOMESTAR legislation. I look forward to working with Congress to get this bill to my desk without delay.
