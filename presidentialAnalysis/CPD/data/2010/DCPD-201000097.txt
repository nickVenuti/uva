Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on Senator Evan Bayh's Decision Not To Seek Reelection February 15, 2010 For more than two decades, Evan Bayh has devoted his career and his life to serving his fellow Hoosiers. During that time, he has fought tirelessly for Indiana's working families, reaching across the aisle on issues ranging from job creation and economic growth to fiscal responsibility and national security. I look forward to continuing to work with him on these critical challenges throughout the rest of the year. Michelle and I thank Senator Bayh for his leadership and service and wish him and his family all the best in their future endeavors. Categories: Statements by the President : Bayh, Sen.
