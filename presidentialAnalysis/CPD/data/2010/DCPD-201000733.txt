Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on the Observance of Eid al-Fitr September 9, 2010 As Ramadan comes to an end, Michelle and I extend our best wishes to Muslims in the United States and around the world on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr. For Muslims all over the world, Eid al-Fitr marks the end of a holy month of fasting and prayer. It is a time of self-reflection focusing on the values that Muslims and people of all faiths share: charity, community, cooperation, and compassion. This year's Eid is also an occasion to reflect on the importance of religious tolerance and to recognize the positive role that religious communities of all faiths, including Muslims, have played in American life. On this Eid, those devastated by the recent floods in Pakistan will be on the minds of many around the world. To help in the tremendous relief, recovery, and reconstruction effort for the floods, all Americans can participate by donating to the Pakistan Relief Fund at www.state.gov. On behalf of the American people, we congratulate Muslims in the United States and around the world on this blessed day. Eid Mubarak. Categories: Statements by the President : Eid al-Fitr.
