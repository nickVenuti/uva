Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on United Nations Accreditation of the International Lesbian and Gay Human Rights Commission July 19, 2010 I welcome this important step forward for human rights as the International Lesbian and Gay Human Rights Commission (ILGHRC) will take its rightful seat at the table of the United Nations. The UN was founded on the premise that only through mutual respect, diversity, and dialog can the international community effectively pursue justice and equality. Today, with the more full inclusion of the International Lesbian and Gay Human Rights Commission, the United Nations is closer to the ideals on which it was founded and to values of inclusion and equality to which the United States is deeply committed.
