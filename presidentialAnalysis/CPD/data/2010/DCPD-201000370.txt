Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on Energy Legislation May 12, 2010  I applaud Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman for their tireless work in drafting this important legislation. This legislation will put America on the path to a clean energy economy that will create American jobs building the solar panels, wind blades, and the car batteries of the future. It will strengthen our national security by beginning to break our dependence on foreign oil. And it will protect our environment for our children and grandchildren.  Americans know what's at stake by continuing our dependence on fossil fuels. But the challenges we face—underscored by the immense tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico—are reason to redouble our efforts to reform our Nation's energy policies. For too long, Washington has kicked this challenge to the next generation. This time, the status quo is no longer acceptable to Americans. Now is the time for America to take control of our energy future and jump-start American innovation in clean energy technology that will allow us to create jobs, compete, and win in the global economy.  The House of Representatives has already taken historic action with passage of the American Clean Energy and Security Act. I look forward to engaging with Senators from both sides of the aisle and ultimately passing a bill this year.  Categories: Statements by the President : Energy legislation.
