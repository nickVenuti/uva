Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2010 Statement on Thad W. Allen's Service October 1, 2010 I am profoundly grateful to Admiral Thad Allen for his years of dedicated service to America and particularly his outstanding leadership of the BP oil spill response effort. At a time when he could have enjoyed a well-deserved retirement from the United States Coast Guard, Admiral Allen stepped up to the plate and served his country when his skills and experience were urgently needed. This unprecedented response effort simply could not have succeeded without Admiral Allen at the helm, and the Nation owes him a debt of gratitude. As we continue to help the people of the Gulf Coast return to their lives and livelihoods, my administration's work will continue to benefit from Admiral Allen's selfless service and dedicated leadership. I wish him well in all of his future endeavors. NOTE: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language version of this statement.
