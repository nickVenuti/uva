To the Congress of the United States:

    I am pleased to submit the Biennial Report of the Office of Ocean 
and Coastal Resource Management, National Ocean Service, National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for fiscal years 1994 and 
1995. This report is submitted as required by section 316 of the Coastal 
Zone Management Act (CZMA) of 1972, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 1451, et 
seq.).
    The report discusses progress made at the national level in 
administering the Coastal Zone Management and Estuarine Research Reserve 
Programs during these years, and spotlights the accomplishments of 
NOAA's State coastal management and estuarine research reserve program 
partners under the CZMA.
