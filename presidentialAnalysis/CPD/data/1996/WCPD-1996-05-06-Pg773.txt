Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus

May 1, 1996

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question. The previous submission covered progress through 
January 31, 1996. The current submission covers the period February 1, 
1996, through March 31, 1996.
    In support of the U.N. Secretary General's good office mission on 
Cyprus, my Administration hopes to be able to take an initiative on 
Cyprus this year. If the two communi-ties possess sufficient political 
will to make tradeoffs required for an intercommunal agreement, we 
believe it should be possible to arrive at a fair and just solution. 
Attaining this goal requires the active support of Turkey and Greece. 
Although unavoidable events have delayed the launching of our Cyprus 
initiative, we have been preparing its

groundwork. In this respect, in March I had a useful session on Cyprus 
with Turkish President Demirel who expressed his government's desire to 
be helpful. I plan on engaging other visitors similarly in the lead-up 
to our Cyprus effort.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
