Message on the Observance of the Chinese New Year

February 8, 1996

    Warm greetings to everyone observing the Chinese New Year as you 
welcome 4694, the Year of the Rat.
    This ancient annual festival unites people of Chinese heritage 
across America and around the globe in a joyous celebration of hope and 
new beginnings. Family and friends gather to renew the bonds of love and 
to rejoice in the rich cultural traditions of the Chinese people. The 
sorrows and mistakes of the past year dissolve in a flurry of fireworks, 
dancing, feasting, and the exchange of gifts.
    The Chinese New Year is a fitting occasion for us to reflect on the 
many contributions that Chinese Americans have brought to our national 
life--among them a respect for family, a reverence for knowledge, and an 
unwavering determination to make tomorrow better than today. Let us 
rejoice together in this season of renewal and resolve to work for a 
future of harmony and prosperity for us all.
    Best wishes for a new year of happiness, health, freedom, and peace.
                                                  Bill Clinton
