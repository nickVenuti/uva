To the Congress of the United States:

    I hereby submit to the Congress a plan to achieve a balanced budget 
not later than the fiscal year 2002 as certified by the Congressional 
Budget Office on January 6, 1996. This plan has been prepared by Senator 
Daschle and if passed in its current form by the Congress, I would sign 
it into law.
