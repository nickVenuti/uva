Statement on the Initiative To Reduce Tobacco Use

May 2, 1996

    Smoking is a pediatric disease that shows no sign of abating, in 
part because young people are constantly barraged by messages that 
glamour and grit can be found in pack of cigarettes.
    My administration has proposed the Nation's first comprehensive 
initiative to reduce children's use of tobacco products. But Government 
cannot solve this problem alone. Everybody must do their share to help 
parents keep their kids tobacco-free.
    I applaud 3M Media for accepting responsibility for the impact 
billboards have. We must all work together to protect our children from 
the lures of tobacco.
