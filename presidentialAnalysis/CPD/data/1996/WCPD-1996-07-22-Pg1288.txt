Statement on Signing Legislation Authorizing Most-Favored-Nation Trade 
Status for Bulgaria

July 18, 1996

    Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 2853, authorizing the 
termination of the application of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 to 
Bulgaria. It permits the President to accord permanent most-favored-
nation (MFN) status to Bulgaria.
    This is an important milestone in U.S.-Bulgarian relations. Bulgaria 
joins Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia as democratic countries 
from which the United States has fully removed trade restrictions that 
originated in concerns about human rights practices during the Cold War 
period. The legislation signals America's confidence in the political 
development of Bulgaria and reaffirms America's commitment to Bulgaria 
as it continues its difficult and historic economic transformation.
    Bulgaria's favorable record on immigration, its progress in the 
protection of human rights and development of a democratic, free-market 
society, and the establishment of cooperative relations with the United 
States helped facilitate passage of H.R. 2853.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
July 18, 1996.

Note: H.R. 2853, approved July 18, was assigned Public Law No. 104-162.
