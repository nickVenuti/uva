Christmas Greeting to the Nation

December 23, 1996

    The President. Hillary and I wish all of you the peace and joy of 
the holiday season, a time for us to rejoice in each other's company and 
in the spirit of the season, a spirit of sharing and giving and making 
peace.
    I want to send a special greeting to all the peacemakers among us, 
especially to our brave men and women in uniform who are away from home. 
You're on a mission of peace. I join with all Americans to thank you for 
your service and to pray for your safe return.
    The First Lady. Christmas is an opportunity for all of us to give 
thanks for the blessings we share as families, friends, and Americans. 
But most important, it is a time for children, and I hope that during 
this holiday season we will remember our Nation's neediest children and 
extend the spirit of giving to them with our love, our prayers, and our 
generosity.
    The President. May the spirit of Christmas and the magic of the 
wonderful season be with you and your loved ones throughout the holidays 
and in the new year to come. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and God 
bless you all.

Note: The greeting was videotaped at 11 a.m. in the Diplomatic Reception 
Room at the White House for later broadcast, and it was released by the 
Office of the Press Secretary on December 23.
