Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Israel

March 3, 1996

    Once again, Americans join with the nation of Israel in their grief. 
On their behalf, I extend to Prime Minister Peres and to all his people 
our heartfelt condolence. We share your anguish and anger at this 
terrorist crime.
    Those responsible again have shown the world that they are 
determined to stop the cause of peace through the brutal murder of 
Israeli citizens. But there must be no misunderstanding: The Palestinian 
people and their leaders, as well as the promise of peace itself, will 
be the true victims if those responsible are not stopped.
    It is imperative that everything possible be done to help ensure 
that these tragic scenes are not repeated. Peacemakers must be as 
resolute as are the destroyers of peace in taking action now to confront 
this terror. To Prime Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat, I pledge that 
the United States will stand with you and with all those--Israelis and 
Palestinians--who support peace as you take up this challenge.
