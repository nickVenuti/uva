Statement on the Death of Calvin A.H. Waller

May 10, 1996

    We mourn the passing of Lieutenant General Calvin A.H. Waller, U.S. 
Army (Ret.), whose dedicated and exceptional career is admired by 
everyone who knew of his extraordinary courage, inspiring leadership, 
and selfless service. During a distinguished career which culminated in 
his service as Deputy Commander of U.S. Forces in the Persian Gulf 
during Operation Desert Storm, General Waller achieved prominence as a 
skillful and disciplined professional and a caring, enthusiastic 
commander. His rise from humble beginnings to one of the highest-ranking 
African-American officers in the U.S. military through stalwart 
determination and a record of excellence served as an inspiration to 
minority and non-minority officers. To General Waller's wife, Marion, 
his family and friends and to the Army community, I extend my deepest 
sympathy. He will be remembered as one of America's finest soldiers and 
most capable military leaders.
