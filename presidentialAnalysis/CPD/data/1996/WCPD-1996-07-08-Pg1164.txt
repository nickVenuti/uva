Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Drought in Southern Plains States

July 1, 1996

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Today, I have proclaimed a State of Emergency due to the extended 
drought in the Southwest, and other natural disasters in feed grain-
producing areas of the United States. The proclamation of a State of 
Emergency will permit the Secretary of Agriculture (``Secretary'') to 
release feed grain supplies from the Disaster Reserve to assist 
livestock producers that have been greatly harmed by the drought. The 
Secretary has prepared a plan that would implement the disposition of 
the feed grain supplies from the Disaster Reserve.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
