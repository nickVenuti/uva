Edmund Muskie

March 26, 1996

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of former 
Senator Edmund Muskie. A dedicated legislator and caring public servant, 
Senator Muskie was a leader in the best sense. He spoke from his heart 
and acted with conviction. Generations to come will benefit from his 
steadfast commitment to protecting the land. Our thoughts and prayers go 
out to his family, his friends, and the people of Maine at this 
difficult time.
