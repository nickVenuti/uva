Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa 1996

December 11, 1996

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Kwanzaa.
    The hearts of millions of men and women across America and around 
the world rejoice as together we enter into the spirit of this uplifting 
holiday. The seven principles of Kwanzaa--unity, self-determination, 
collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, 
creativity, and faith--teach us that when we come together to strengthen 
our families and communities and honor the lessons of the past, we can 
face the future with joy and optimism. Through prayer, song, and the 
exchange of gifts, Kwanzaa helps us celebrate the human experience and 
appreciate our many blessings.

    Today, we have a renewed sense of hope in America, a hope based on 
the idea that our great diversity can unite--not divide--our society. As 
we rejoice in the rich cultural heritage of the African American 
community during Kwanzaa, let us work together to ensure that the 
meaning and energy of this inspiring festival will remain with us 
throughout the coming year, bringing courage, renewal, and even greater 
hope for the future.
    Hillary joins me in sending best wishes for a wonderful holiday and 
every happiness in the year ahead.
                                                  Bill Clinton
