Statement on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Report on 
Adolescent Tobacco Use

May 23, 1996

    Regarding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Report: 
``Tobacco Use and Usual Source of Cigarettes Among High School 
Students--United States, 1995:''
    Today's report is disturbing proof that more and more young 
teenagers are becoming lifelong smokers and too little is being done to 
prevent illegal tobacco sales to them. The significant increase in 
smoking among young African-American men is of particular concern.
    Parents and communities need tough and enforceable measures to 
combat the easy access and appeal of cigarettes to children. My 
administration remains committed to preventing adolescent decisions from 
becoming lifelong addictions. I ask all Americans to support strong 
measures that will effectively address the growing problem of tobacco 
use by our children.
