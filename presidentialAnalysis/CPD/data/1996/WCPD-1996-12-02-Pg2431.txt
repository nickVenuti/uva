    Q. Mr. President, you promised to raise some candid differences. 
What differences do you want to raise?
    The President. [Inaudible]--four good meetings, we're going to have 
another one. Then we'll have a report.
    Q. Human Rights Watch says you're making a mistake by holding the 
meeting. Are you?
    The President. No, we're doing the right thing to have this meeting.
