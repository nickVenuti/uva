Memorandum on the Welfare Initiative for Teen Parents

May 10, 1996

Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services

Subject: Welfare Initiative Regarding Teen Parents

    This memorandum will confirm my directive to you to implement the 
plan I announced on Saturday, May 4, 1996, to help teen parents break 
free of the cycle of welfare dependency by living at home, staying

in school, and getting the education they need to get good jobs.
    I direct you to exercise your legal authority to take the following 
steps to implement that plan:
(1)         require States to submit plans describing how they will 
            ensure that teen parents stay in school and prepare for 
            employment;
(2)         require teen parents who have dropped out of school to sign 
            personal responsibility plans that spell out how such teens 
            are going to move towards supporting and caring for 
            themselves and their children, including attendance at 
            school;
(3)         allow States to reward with cash allowances teen parents who 
            stay in school and graduate, as well as require States to 
            sanction teens who do not;
(4)         challenge States to use the authority they have to require 
            minor mothers to live at home; and
(5)         monitor State performance in the foregoing areas.
    You have advised me that you have legal authority to take these 
actions under titles IV-A and IV-F of the Social Security Act.
    The plan I have outlined will help assure that the welfare system 
requires teen parents to follow responsible paths to independence. Its 
swift implementation is vital to achieving our goal of further 
instilling the American values of work, family, and personal 
responsibility into our welfare system.
                                            William J. Clinton
