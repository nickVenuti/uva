Statement on the Resignation of Political Consultant Dick Morris

August 29, 1996

    Dick Morris is my friend, and he is a superb political strategist. I 
am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made 
to my campaigns, and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the 
last 2 years.
