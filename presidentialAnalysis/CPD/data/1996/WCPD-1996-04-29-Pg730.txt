Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture

Subject: Suspension of Subsection 325(a) and Subsection 325(b) of the 
Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appro- priations Act, 
1996, (``Act'') as set forth in Section 101(c) of Title I of the Omnibus 
Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (H.R. 3019) 
Concerning the Tongass National Forest

    By the authority vested in me by subsection 325(c) of the Department 
of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996, (``Act'') 
as set forth in section 101(c) of title I of the Omnibus Consolidated 
Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (H.R. 3019), and section 301 
of title 3, United States Code, I hereby suspend subsections 325(a) and 
325(b) of the Act because I have determined that such suspension is 
appropriate based upon the public interest in sound environmental 
management and protection of cultural, biological, or historic 
resources.
    This suspension shall take effect immediately and shall continue in 
effect for the period in which subsection 325(a) and subsection 325(b) 
of the Act would otherwise be in effect.
    You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the 
Federal Register.

                                            William J. Clinton
