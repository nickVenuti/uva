Message to the Congress on Trade With China

February 6, 1996

To the Congress of the United States:

    Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902(b)(2) of the 
Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public 
Law 101-246), and as President of the United States, I hereby report to 
the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States to 
waive the restrictions contained in that Act on the export to the 
People's Republic of China of U.S.-origin satellites insofar as such 
restrictions pertain to the CHINASAT project.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
February 6, 1996.
