Message on the Observance of Eid al-Adha

April 26, 1996

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Eid al-Adha.
    An observance of sacrifice and a celebration of faith, Eid al-Adha 
is a sacred day for Muslims in our nation and around the world. On this 
special day, the entire global Muslim community joins in spirit with 
those who have traveled to Mecca to complete the Hajj.
    The Festival of the Sacrifice reminds all of us of the need for 
obedience to God, prompts us to reflect on God's mercy, and gives 
participants a welcome opportunity to join with friends and family in a 
community celebration of faith. In commemorating this holy day, Muslims 
in America and in countries around the world serve as a source of strong 
faith that can enrich our lives and strengthen our common values.
    Best wishes for a memorable and meaningful observance.
                                                  Bill Clinton
