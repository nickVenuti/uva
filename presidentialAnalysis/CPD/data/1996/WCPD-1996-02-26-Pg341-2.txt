Remarks on the Observance of Eid al-Fitr

February 20, 1996

    On behalf of all Americans, I want to extend my personal greetings 
to the entire Muslim community here in the United States and around the 
world as it celebrates the Eid al-Fitr.
    This week marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. It is a time 
for rejoicing and celebration, but it is also a time for reflection and 
rededication. On this occasion, let us rekindle our commitment to the 
cause of peace among all the peoples of the Earth. If we are dedicated 
in our belief and constant in our labor, we can build a better future, 
one of cooperation, understanding, and compassion, for ourselves and for 
our children.
    Let us also remember the values of family and community, as well as 
our responsibility for those who are less fortunate, ideals that lie at 
the heart of Ramadan. These principles of personal commitment to faith 
and to society truly are universal values.
    So as the new Moon ushers in this holy celebration, let me say to 
all who follow the

traditional greeting: As-Salaamu Alaykum, may peace be with you, and may 
God grant you health and prosperity now and in the years ahead.
