Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders

January 2, 1996

Budget Negotiations

    Q. Mr. President, is this the meeting at which you're going to start 
making some compromises on the most contentious issues?
    The President. Well, I'm looking forward to it, and I hope we can 
reach an agreement. I want to compliment the Senate on voting to reopen 
the Government today for the next several days while we attempt to 
finalize this, and I hope the House will follow suit. That's a very good 
sign, and I'm looking forward to the meeting tonight.
    Q. Will the House follow suit, Mr. Speaker?
    Speaker Gingrich. Well, our Members will be back by noon tomorrow, 
and we hope to meet with all of them and brief them on tonight's meeting 
and whatever happens tomorrow morning and maybe get something done 
during the day tomorrow. I think if we can both get movement on the 
balanced budget and get the Government back to work, and paid for, that 
really would be a good step in the right direction.
    Q. Will you encourage them to take the Senate bill?
    Speaker Gingrich. We're going to have a good meeting tonight, and 
we'll report to the Members what happened when they get back tomorrow.

Note: The exchange began at 6:15 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this
