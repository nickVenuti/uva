Message to the Congress on Trade With Bulgaria

July 17, 1996

To the Congress of the United States:

    On June 3, 1993, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Bulgaria is in full compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria 
of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This action allowed 
for the continuation of most-favored-nation (MFN) status for Bulgaria 
and certain other activities without the requirement of a waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the 
Congress concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of 
Bulgaria. The report indicates continued Bulgarian compliance with U.S. 
and international standards in the area of emigration policy.
                                            William J. Clinton
      
The White House,
July 17, 1996.
