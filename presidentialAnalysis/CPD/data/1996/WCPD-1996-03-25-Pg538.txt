Statement on the Tentative Agreement To End the General Motors Strike

March 21, 1996

    I am pleased that the United Auto Workers and General Motors have 
reached a tentative agreement. GM and the UAW have a long and proud 
history of working together to solve their disputes. Both sides have 
worked hard to settle this dispute and I congratulate them for spending 
long hours at the bargaining table and arriving at a tentative agreement 
which will hopefully send more than 150,000 workers back to their jobs.
    When American corporations work together with their workers, we can 
meet our challenge to grow the economy and provide families higher wages 
and increased economic security.
