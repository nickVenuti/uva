Statement on Signing the Helium Privatization Act of 1996

October 9, 1996

    I have signed into law today H.R. 4168, the Helium Privatization Act 
of 1996, which privatizes the Department of Interior's Federal Helium 
Refining Program--as the Vice President's National Performance Review 
had recommended.
    Once, our defense and aviation industries had a strong need for 
helium and the Nation lacked a market to supply it. A Government program 
was appropriate. But today, over 90 percent of U.S. helium needs are met 
by private producers and suppliers. A Govern-

ment-operated program is no longer needed. The private sector can meet, 
and now will be able to compete to supply, the needs of all users.
    The bill brings us closer to our goal of creating a Government that 
works better and costs less.

Note: H.R. 4168, approved October 9, was assigned Public Law No. 104-
273.
