March 27, 1996

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with section 540 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360qq) (previously section 360D of the Public 
Health Service Act), I am submitting the report of the Department of 
Health and Human Services regarding the administration of the Radiation 
Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 during calendar year 1994.
    The report recommends the repeal of section 540 of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act that requires the completion of this annual 
report. All the information found in this report is available to the 
Congress on a more immediate basis through the Center for Devices and 
Radiological Health technical reports, the Radiological Health Bulletin, 
and other publicly available sources. The Agency resources devoted to 
the preparation of this report could be put to other, better uses.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
March 27, 1996.
