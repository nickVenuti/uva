Statement on the Death of Former Representative Mike Synar

January 9, 1996

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn this morning of the 
death of former Oklahoma Congressman Mike Synar. Mike Synar was a brave 
and unflinching public servant who in tough political times remained 
true to his principles. He did not always do what was popular, but he 
always did what he thought was right--for Oklahoma and for America. 
Throughout his life, and especially during the past 6 months, Mike Synar 
was a true profile in courage.
    Hillary and I will miss him. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his 
family and friends at this difficult time.
