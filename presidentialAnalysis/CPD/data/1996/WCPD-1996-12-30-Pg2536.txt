Statement on Anniversary of the Bombing of Pan American Flight 103 Over 
Lockerbie, Scotland

December 20, 1996

    On this day eight years ago, Pan American Flight 103 was savagely 
torn from the skies over Lockerbie, Scotland. We have not forgotten the 
270 victims who perished in that cowardly act of terrorism. And we have 
not forgotten their families. On behalf of the American people, we 
remember your loss today. We draw strength from your dignity and your 
courage. You are not alone in your determination to see that the 
perpetrators of this evil deed are brought to justice. Your

country stands with you and shares your continuing grief.
    The sponsors of terrorism hope that with the passing of time the 
world will forget their crimes. We will not forget. Time has not 
diminished our outrage, and it never will. We are determined to see that 
those who committed these murders are brought to justice. That is why we 
continue to demand the extradition of the two Libyans who have been 
indicted for this vicious offense to stand trial in the U.S. or U.K. It 
is also why we have pushed for and secured tough international sanctions 
against Libya that we strengthened further with legislation in 1996. We 
will not rest until this case is closed and justice is done.

Note: This statement was embargoed for release by the Office of the 
Press Secretary until 12 noon on December 21, the anniversary date of 
the bombing. This item was not received in time for publication in the
