Telephone Remarks to the Community of Rochester, New Hampshire

February 17, 1996

    I'm sorry I'm not there, but I'm on the way. We spent 2 hours on the 
runway in Washington today, waiting for a weather clearance. If you'll 
wait for me I'll be there. I'm looking forward to it.
    I know between Jeanne Shaheen and everybody else that's there you 
can find plenty of people to speak until I get there. Just tell old 
stories and reminisce, and I'll be there as quick as I can.
    Thank you. Good-bye.

Note: The President spoke at 10:40 a.m. aboard Air Force One while en 
route to Pease International Trade Port. In his remarks, he referred to 
Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire State senator.
