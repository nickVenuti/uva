Statement on the Railroad Accident in Silver Spring, Maryland

February 17, 1996

    Today all Americans extend our thoughts and prayers to the families 
of the people who died in the train crash last night. We are working 
hard to find out what caused this tragedy.
    Several young men and women who died were Job Corps trainees, 
returning from a training center in West Virginia--taking a journey of 
personal responsibility. They were working hard to better themselves, 
and we salute their lives as we mourn their deaths.
