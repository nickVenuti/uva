    As a mark of respect for the memory of Admiral Arleigh Burke, one of 
our Nation's foremost naval heroes, I hereby order, by the authority 
vested in me as President of the United States of America by section 175 
of title 36 of the United States Code, that the flag of the United 
States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and 
grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval 
vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and 
throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until 
interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for 
the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular 
offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities 
and naval vessels and stations.
    In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.
