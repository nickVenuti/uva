Memorandum for the Secretary of State

Subject: Determination Under Subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 
1974, as Amended--Continuation of Waiver Authority

    Pursuant to subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (the ``Act''), I determine that the further extension of the 
waiver authority granted by subsection 402(c) of the Act will 
substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act. I 
further determine that the continuation of the waivers applicable to 
Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Moldova, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan 
will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act.
    You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the 
Federal Register.
                                            William J. Clinton
