Statement on House of Representatives Action To Renew Most-Favored-
Nation Trade Status for China

June 27, 1996

    I applaud the action of the House of Representatives to approve my 
decision to renew most-favored-nation trade status for China. The strong 
bipartisan show of support today is clear evidence that the American 
people agree that engagement, not isolation, is the best way to advance 
America's interests with China as elsewhere.
    This positive vote helps us continue to engage China on a broad 
range of issues, including human rights, nonproliferation, trade, 
regional security, and relations with Taiwan. It enables us to continue 
to strengthen cooperation while firmly addressing our differences. It is 
a strong vote in favor of America's interests.
    As I meet with the G-7 leaders, this vote is also a strong 
reaffirmation of America's continued leadership and engagement in the 
world.
    I thank the House of Representatives for its overwhelming support 
and look forward to continuing our work with the Congress on a 
bipartisan China policy that advances America's interests.
