Letter to Congressional Leaders on Naval Petroleum Reserves Production

October 7, 1996

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    In accordance with section 201(3) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves 
Production Act of 1976 (10 U.S.C. 7422(c)(2)), I am informing you of my 
decision to extend the period of production of the naval petroleum 
reserves for a period of 3 years from April 5, 1997, the expiration date 
of the currently authorized period of production.
    Attached is a copy of the report investigating the necessity of 
continued production of the reserves as required by section 
201(3)(c)(2)(B) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976. 
In light of the findings contained in that report, I certify

that continued production from the naval petroleum reserves is in the 
national interest.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
