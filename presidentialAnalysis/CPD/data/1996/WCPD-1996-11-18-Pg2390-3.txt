Statement on the Resignation of Assistant Attorney General for Civil 
Rights Deval Patrick

November 14, 1996

    It was with regret that I accepted today the resignation of Deval 
Patrick, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department 
of Justice, who has decided to return to private life. Throughout his 
tenure, Deval was one of my closest and most trusted advisers in the 
area of civil rights. He brought to his job a love of his country and an 
unflagging commitment to equal opportunity for all Americans.
    The country will miss his able service, but we can all be proud of 
the many accomplishments he leaves behind, including his work at the 
forefront of my administration's effort

to reform affirmative action programs in Federal procurement. Deval took 
to heart my admonition to mend affirmative action, not end it. The 
intelligence and sensitivity he brought to this difficult job has paid 
off with solid results.
    Another hallmark of his tenure was his stewardship of the 
interagency task force created to investigate the rash of fires 
threatening our Nation's places of worship. Deval was instrumental in 
leading the fight to protect these institutions and to bring 
perpetrators of the burnings to justice.
    I will always appreciate the sacrifice Deval's wife, Diane, and 
their children made so that Deval could provide this service to his 
country.
