Income and Capital, signed at Luxembourg April 3, 1996. Accompanying the 
Convention is a related exchange of notes providing clarification with 
respect to the application of the Convention in specified cases. Also 
transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the 
Department of State with respect to the Convention.
    This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United 
States and other OECD nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be 
applied to various types of income and protection from double taxation 
of income. The Convention also provides for exchange of information to 
prevent fiscal evasion and sets forth standard rules to limit the 
benefits of the Convention to persons that are not engaged in treaty 
shopping.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
