Statement on the Japan-United States Semiconductor Agreement

August 2, 1996

    I want to congratulate Ambassador Barshefsky and her entire 
negotiating team on the agreement reached today on semiconductors. Their 
tireless efforts to advance our Nation's economic interests around the 
world have reaped enormous benefits for America's businesses and 
workers.
    This agreement achieves our goals of transparency and monitoring of 
the semiconductor market to assure market access for our companies. The 
semiconductor industry serves as an engine for growth and jobs and has 
regained its position as world leader in semiconductor production.
