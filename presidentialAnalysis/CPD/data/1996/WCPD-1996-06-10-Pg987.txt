Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Former Eastern Bloc States

June 3, 1996

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''), with respect to a 
further 12-month extension of the authority to waive subsections (a) and 
(b) of section 402 of the Act. This document constitutes my 
recommendation to continue in effect this waiver authority for a further 
12-month period, and includes my reasons for determining that 
continuation of the waiver authority and waivers currently in effect for 
Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Moldova, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan 
will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act. I 
have submitted a separate report with respect to the People's Republic 
of China.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
