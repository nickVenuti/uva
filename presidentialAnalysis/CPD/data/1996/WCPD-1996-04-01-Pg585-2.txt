cans an immediate pay increase. With every day that the Republican 
leadership continues to stall, the value of the minimum wage continues

working full time at the minimum wage. If we value work and we value 
families, we ought to raise the value of the minimum wage. With the 5-

the time to put politics aside, raise the minimum wage, and help lift 
the lives of millions of America's workers.
