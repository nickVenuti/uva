    I deeply regret the death today in Bosnia of an American soldier who 
was killed this morning when he stepped on a landmine. This is the first 
fatality that U.S. forces have suffered in Operation Joint Endeavor.
    Hillary and I join all Americans in extending our deepest sympathies 
to his family. They should know that he died in the noblest of causes, 
the pursuit of peace.
    Since before Operation Joint Endeavor began, I have said it entails 
real risks. But our commanders have provided our troops with the finest 
training and equipment to confront the challenges in Bosnia. We will 
continue to take every precaution to protect American troops as they 
continue to perform this critical mission of securing an enduring peace 
in Bosnia.
