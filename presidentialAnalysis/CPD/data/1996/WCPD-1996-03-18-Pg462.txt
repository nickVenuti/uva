Statement on the Death of George Burns

March 9, 1996

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of 
the great entertainers of all time. Like all Americans, we are grateful 
George Burns kept us laughing for so long. As a young boy I enjoyed the 
Burns and Allen show every week. His sense of timing and captivating 
smile touched the hearts and funny bones of more than three generations. 
He enabled us to see humor in the toughest of times and laugh together 
as a Nation.
    We will miss him greatly. Our prayers and sympathies go to his 
family and friends.
