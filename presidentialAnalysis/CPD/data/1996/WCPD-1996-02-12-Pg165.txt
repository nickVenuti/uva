Statement on the Circuit Court Decision on Replacement Workers

February 2, 1996

    The right of workers to strike has long been one of America's envied 
freedoms. Last year, I signed an Executive order prohibiting Federal 
contractors from permanently replacing workers who exercise their 
legitimate and historic right to strike.
    This Executive order--which furthers the economic and efficient 
administration of Federal contracts--signals the kind of productive 
labor-management relationships that are needed in today's economy.
    I regret today's decision by the DC Circuit Court overturning this 
order. I strongly believe that this Executive order is economically 
sound, fair, and legal, and accordingly I am instructing my Justice 
Department to take all appropriate steps to have this decision 
overturned.
