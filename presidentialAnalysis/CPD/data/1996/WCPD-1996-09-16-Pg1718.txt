Memorandum on Employees Affected by Hurricane Fran and its Aftermath

September 10, 1996

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Excused Absence for Employees Affected by Hurricane Fran and 
its Aftermath

    I am deeply concerned about the devastating losses caused by 
Hurricane Fran and the impact on the well-being and livelihood of our 
fellow Americans who have been affected by this disaster. Elements of 
the Federal Government have been mobilized to respond to this disaster.
    As part of this effort, I request heads of executive departments and 
agencies who have Federal civilian employees in the areas designated as 
disaster areas because of the effects of Hurricane Fran and its 
aftermath to use their discretion to excuse from duty, without charge to 
leave or loss of pay, any such employee who is faced with a personal 
emergency because of this storm and who can be spared from his or her 
usual responsibilities. This policy should also be applied to any 
employee who is needed for emergency law enforcement, relief, or clean-
up efforts authorized by Federal, State, or local officials having 
jurisdiction.
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press Secretary
