Statement on Tax Provisions for American Troops in Bosnia

February 26, 1996

    Today, in recognition of the sacrifices members of the U.S. Armed 
Forces are making in and around Bosnia, I am asking Congress to extend 
to them a series of special tax rules.
    Historically, these provisions--which include extending the time to 
file returns and certain tax relief for those serving under hostile 
conditions--have been restricted to individuals deployed in ``combat 
zones.'' However, the men and women of today's military confront 
hardships and risks in non-combat missions like the one we have 
undertaken in Bosnia. I believe the law should be extended to cover 
them. I look forward to working with Congress to enact these changes as 
quickly as possible.
