Agreement

September 3, 1996

To the Senate of the United States:

    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and 
the Government of the Republic of Turkey for the Avoidance of Double 
Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on 
Income, together with a related Protocol, signed at Washington March 28, 
1996. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report 
of the Department of State with respect to the Agreement.
    This Agreement, which is similar to tax treaties between the United 
States and other OECD nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be 
applied to various types of income, protection from double taxation of 
income, exchange of information to prevent fiscal evasion, and standard 
rules to limit the benefits of the Agreement to persons that are not 
engaged in treaty shopping.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Agree-
