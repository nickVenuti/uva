Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I ask you to support the 
campaign by personally chairing it in your Agency and appointing a top 
official as your vice chair.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. This year our goal 
is to raise more than $38 million. Public servants not only contribute 
to the campaign, but assume leadership roles to ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help guarantee another 
successful campaign this year.
                                                  Bill Clinton
