Southwest and other natural disasters in other feed grain areas of the 
United States have resulted in a state of emergency and that the state 
of emergency warrants the release of the reserve established pursuant to 
section 813(a) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1427a(a)). Accordingly, I hereby 
declare that such amounts of the reserve as determined necessary by the 
Secretary of Agriculture (``the Secretary'') should be disposed of by 
the Secretary as authorized by the Act.
    In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of

the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.
