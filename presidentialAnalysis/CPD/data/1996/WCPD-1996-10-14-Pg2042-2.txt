Statement on Action Against International Drug Trafficking

October 11, 1996

    I want to congratulate Attorney General Reno, Treasury Secretary 
Rubin, their crime fighting teams, and all law enforcement officers who 
worked to ensure the breakup of another notorious international drug 
ring through Operation Global S.E.A. Building on the success of this 
May's Operation Zorro II, the breakup of this drug network marks another 
milestone in our effort to cripple major international drug trafficking 
cartels.
    I want to commend the unprecedented cooperation between frontline 
law enforcement agencies on the Federal, State, and local levels that 
brought down this narcotic network. My administration will continue to 
work with determination to track down and convict those who would 
threaten our communities and our children.
