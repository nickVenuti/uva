Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Memorandum on Most-
Favored-Nation Status for China

May 31, 1996

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''), with respect to the 
continuation of a waiver of application of subsections (a) and (b) of 
section 402 of the Act to the People's Republic of China. This document 
constitutes my recommendation to continue in effect this waiver for a 
further 12-month period and includes my reasons for determining that 
continuation of the waiver currently in effect for the People's Republic 
of China will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the 
Act, and my determination to that effect.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
