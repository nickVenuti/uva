Remarks on Signing the Cancer Control Month Proclamation

March 29, 1996

    Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we're going to have a ceremony 
over in the East Room in just a few moments, so I don't want to make my 
remarks twice. Let me just say that there is hardly a family in America 
who has not been touched by cancer. We have come a very, very long way 
in the fight against cancer. More people are survivors than ever before; 
more people are living longer than ever before. But we have a great deal 
more to do before we can be confident that we have actually done 
everything possible to give our children and our grandchildren the kind 
of future they deserve.
    And that's what this day is about. And that's what this proclamation 
declaring April Cancer Control Month is all about. And I'm glad to sign 
it, especially with these children behind me because they are the 
embodiment of our common endeavors.

Note: The President spoke at 3:34 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House.
