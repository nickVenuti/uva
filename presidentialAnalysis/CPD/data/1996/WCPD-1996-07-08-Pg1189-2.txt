Statement on the Results of the Russian Election

July 3, 1996

    As we wait to receive the final results of the Russian elections, 
and as our Nation prepares to celebrate our own freedom and 
independence, I want to recognize the historic significance of what we 
have seen in Russia today.
    From Vladivostok to Kaliningrad, tens of millions of Russians 
returned to the polls to complete the process of selecting their 
President. The Russian people can take real pride in this extraordinary 
achievement. After centuries of imperial rule and decades of Communist 
oppression, they have asserted their right to have a voice in the 
decisions that affect their lives. This election process shows just how 
far Russia's political reform has come over the last 5 years.
    The American people can take pride as well in our steady support for 
Russia's democratic reform. As the results are counted, we will shortly 
learn the choice of the Russian people. But one thing is clear: Today 
was a triumph for democracy in Russia.
