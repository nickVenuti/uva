Statement on the 100th Birthday of George Burns

January 20, 1996

    Hillary and I extend our warmest wishes for a wonderful birthday to 
one of the most talented entertainers of our time. George Burns' knowing 
smile and dry wit have touched the hearts and funny bones of three 
generations. His impeccable timing breathed life into the mundane, and 
his clever humor crystallized many ageless skits. His youthful attitude, 
now a century old, continues to inspire us today. We send him all our 
best on this happy occasion.
