Statement on Signing Legislation Waiving Certain Enrollment Requirements

April 9, 1996

    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 168, which waives the 
printing requirements of sections 106 and 107 of title 1 of the United 
States Code with respect to H.R. 3019 and H.R. 3136. I do so to avoid 
any confusion as to my ability to act on any form of that legislation 
presented to me after certification by the Committee on House Oversight 
of the House of Representatives that the form is a true enrollment. In 
signing the resolution, I express no view as to whether it is necessary 
to waive the provisions of title 1 before I exercise my prerogatives 
under Article I, section 7, of the Constitution where the Congress has 
presented to me any form of bill it considers to be a true enrollment.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
April 9, 1996.

 Note: H.J. Res. 168, approved April 9, was assigned Public Law No. 104-
129.
