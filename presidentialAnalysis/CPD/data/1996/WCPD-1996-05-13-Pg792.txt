Message on the Observance of Cinco de Mayo, 1996

May 4, 1996

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
    Each year the Fifth of May reminds us of the blessings of our 
nation's rich cultural diversity. The Mexican people have made profound 
and lasting contributions to our society, enriching our national life 
with the values of family, faith, and love of country.
    In commemorating the victory of Mexico's army at the Battle of 
Puebla, we rededicate ourselves to strengthening the bonds of friendship 
and partnership between the peoples of Mexico and the United States. Our 
nations share a legacy of independence and courage in the face of 
adversity, and each time we celebrate Cinco de Mayo, we reaffirm our 
reverence for these ideals.
    Hillary and I send best wishes to all for a wonderful holiday.
                                                  Bill Clinton
