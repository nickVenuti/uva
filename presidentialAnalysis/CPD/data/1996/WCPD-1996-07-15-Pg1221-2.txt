Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting

July 9, 1996

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 
U.S.C. 396(i)), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1995 and the Inventory of 
the Federal Funds Distributed to Public Telecommunications Entities by 
Federal Departments and Agencies: Fiscal Year 1995.
    Since 1967, when the Congress created the Corporation, CPB has 
overseen the growth and development of quality services for millions of 
Americans.
    This year's report highlights ways the Corporation has helped 
millions of American families and children gain new learning 
opportunities through technology. At a time when technology is advancing 
at a pace that is as daunting as it is exhilarating, it is crucial for 
all of us to work together to understand and take advantage of these 
changes.
    By continuing to broadcast programs that explore the challenging 
issues of our time, by working with local communities and schools to 
introduce more and more children to computers and the Internet, in 
short, by honoring its commitment to enriching the American spirit, the 
Corporation is preparing all of us for the 21st century.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
July 9, 1996.
