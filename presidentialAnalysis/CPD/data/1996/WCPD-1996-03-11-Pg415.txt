Statement on Representative Sam Gibbons' Decision Not To Seek Reelection

March 4, 1996

    Congress has lost a tenacious champion of America's elderly and an 
unrelenting fighter for health care reform, open markets, and free trade 
with today's decision by Representative Sam Gibbons not to seek 
reelection.
    From his days as a hero on the beaches of Normandy through his 34 
years in Congress, Sam Gibbons has served his country and fought for 
what he believed. As a Congressman, Representative Gibbons has been a 
leader in domestic policy, particularly in the defense of America's 
senior citizens and the protection of their health care. In recent 
years, he has worked tirelessly on efforts to provide health care 
coverage to all Americans.
    The American people are grateful for Sam Gibbons' long service. His 
deep dedication to the Congress and to the American people will be 
sorely missed.
