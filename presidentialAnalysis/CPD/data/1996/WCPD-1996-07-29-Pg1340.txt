Remarks Prior to a Meeting on the Recovery Efforts for TWA Flight 800 in 
Jamaica, New York

July 25, 1996

    The President. [The President's remarks are joined in progress]--
have a briefing from all the folks who have been working on this 
terrible tragedy, making an effort to recover the bodies as quickly as 
possible and find out what caused the crash. And I'm looking forward to 
that briefing and having a chance to thank them for the efforts they've 
made and then to go over and meet with the families.
    I want to thank the Members of the Congress, the Governor, and other 
officials from New York, and particularly the Ambassadors from France 
and Italy for being here with me. And I'm anxious to get on with the 
morning.
    Thank you.
    Q. Are you satisfied with the efforts to recover the bodies even as 
the search for clues as to the cause of this tragedy is underway?
    The President. I will have a statement after we meet this morning, 
and I'd prefer to wait and answer all my questions then.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 9:40 a.m. in Port Authority 
Building 14 at John F. Kennedy International Airport. In his remarks,

Salleo, and Ambassador to the U.S. from France, Francois Bujon de 
l'Estang. A tape was not available for verification of the content of
