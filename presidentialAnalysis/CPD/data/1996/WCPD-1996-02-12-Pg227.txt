Statement on the Terrorist Attack in London, United Kingdom

February 9, 1996

    All Americans join Hillary and me in our outrage at the bomb 
explosion today in London. I condemn in the strongest possible terms 
this cowardly action and hope those responsible are brought swiftly to 
justice. Our hearts and prayers go out to those injured in this terrible 
blast and to their families.
    I am deeply concerned by reports that the Irish Republican Army has 
announced an end to the cease-fire. For a year and a half, the people of 
the United Kingdom and Ireland have enjoyed living in peace, free to go 
about their daily lives without the threat of the bomb and the bullet. 
As was clear during my visit to Northern Ireland last year, the people 
want peace. No one and no organization has the right to deny them that 
wish.
    The terrorists who perpetrated today's attack cannot be allowed to 
derail the effort to bring peace to the people of Northern Ireland--a 
peace they overwhelmingly support.
    The United States stands ready to assist the two Governments in 
continuing their search for negotiations and peace. Today's action 
underscores the urgent need for all sides to join in the fight against 
terrorism and to press forward in that search.
