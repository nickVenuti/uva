Remarks at ``In Performance at the White House''

May 6, 1996

    Thank you very much. There is another benefit to you that we heard

    It has been said of Aaron Neville that when he sings, ``It's like a 
knowing angel who has experienced both Heaven and the gritty reality of 
a working man's life.'' Aaron's style reflects the lush multi-cultural 
mix of his native city of New Orleans. He has blended rock and funk, 
gospel and country, and rhythm and blues, to create the rich, exciting 
sound that is unmistakably all his own.
    Our other guest reflects the finest spirit of our great country. Her 
willingness to experiment, while maintaining the best of the past has 
helped her sell more than 30 million recordings. By combining the 
mariachi sounds of Mexico, big band swing, rock and roll, Broadway, and 
opera, she has won devoted followers everywhere in the music world.
    Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce Linda Ronstadt.

Note: The President spoke at 8 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House.
