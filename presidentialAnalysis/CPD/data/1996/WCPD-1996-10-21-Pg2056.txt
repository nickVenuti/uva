Statement on Anticrime Initiatives

October 13, 1996

    All Americans can be pleased with today's report that our Nation's 
crime rate is at a 10-year low and we have reduced murder and violent 
crime rates to their lowest levels since 1989. Our anticrime strategy--
to put more police on the street while working to get drugs, gangs, and 
guns out of our neighborhoods--is working.
    We can be proud of the progress we have made, but there is still 
much work to be done. We must bear down even harder on violent juvenile 
crime. Last May, I submitted to Congress the Anti-Gang and Youth 
Violence Control Act of 1996. Enacting that bill's tough, new measures 
is my top anticrime priority.
