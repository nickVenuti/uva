Message to the Congress on Trade With China

June 23, 1996

To the Congress of the United States:

    Pursuant to the authority vested in me by Section 902(b)(2) of the 
Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (P.L. 
101-246) (``the Act''), and as President of the United States, I hereby 
report to Congress that it is in the national interest of the United 
States to terminate the suspensions under section 902(a) of the Act with 
respect to the issuance of licenses for defense article exports to the 
People's Republic of China and the export of U.S.-origin satellites, 
insofar as such restrictions pertain to the Hughes Asia Pacific Mobile 
Telecommunications project. License requirements remain in place for 
these exports and require review and approval on a case-by-case basis by 
the United States Government.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
June 23, 1996.
