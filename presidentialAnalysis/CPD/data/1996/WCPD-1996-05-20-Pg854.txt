Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report of the National Science 
Board

May 15, 1996

To the Congress of the United States:

    As required by 42 U.S.C. 1863(j)(1), I am pleased to submit to the 
Congress a report of the National Science Board entitled Science and 
Engineering Indicators--1996. This report represents the twelfth in a 
series examining key aspects of the status of American science and 
engineering in a global environment.
    The science and technology enterprise is a source of discovery and 
inspiration and is key to the future of our Nation. The United States 
must sustain world leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering 
if we are to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.
    I commend Science and Engineering Indicators--1996 to the attention 
of the Congress and those in the scientific and technology communities.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
May 15, 1996.
