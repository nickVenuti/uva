Statement on Senate Action on the Line-Item Veto

March 28, 1996

    I want to commend the Senate for passing legislation to give the 
President line-item veto authority. While not a perfect bill, the 
conference report as passed by the Senate will give Presidents the 
ability to cut wasteful Government spending and special interest tax 
provisions.
    I have advocated the line-item veto for a very long time. I had the 
line-item veto when I was Governor of Arkansas; I advocated the line-
item veto when I ran for President; and I have pursued it since becoming 
President.
    The President, no matter what party, needs the line-item veto to 
ensure that our public resources are put to the best possible uses 
during these times of tight budgets. While I note that this authority 
does not become effective until the next Congress, I urge the House to 
follow the Senate's lead and pass the conference report now.
