Remarks on Departure From Toledo

October 29, 2004

Al Jazeera Videotape of Usama bin Laden

    Earlier today I was informed of the tape that is now being analyzed 
by America's intelligence community. Let me make this very clear: 
Americans will not be intimidated or influenced by an enemy of our 
country. I'm sure Senator Kerry agrees with this.
    I also want to say to the American people that we're at war with 
these terrorists, and I am confident that we will prevail.
    Thank you very much. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 5:53 p.m. at Toledo Express Airport. A tape 
was not available for verification of the content of these remarks. This 
item was not received in time for publication in the appropriate issue.
