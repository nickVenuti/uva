Statement on Representative
Ralph M. Hall's Joining the
Republican Party

January 2, 2004

    I welcome Congressman Ralph Hall to the Republican Party. Ralph is a 
close friend of the Bush family. He is a well-respected leader of the 
highest integrity and a tireless advocate for the people of Texas. We 
have worked closely together on the important challenges facing our 
Nation. I strongly support his re-election.
