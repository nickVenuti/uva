Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Consistent with my constitutional authority and section 446 of the 
District of Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act, as amended, I

    The proposed Fiscal Year 2005 Budget Request Act reflects the major 
programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of 
Columbia. For Fiscal Year 2005, the District estimates total revenues 
and expenditures of $6.26 billion.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the

Senate.
