    President Bush. I've really been looking forward to meeting the 
Prime Minister.

a friend of the United States.
    And I'm proud you're here, sir.
    Prime Minister Singh. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm very, very happy 
to be in this land of opportunity that the United States is. And under 
your distinguished leadership, our two countries' relations have grown 
in diverse ways, but I do believe that the best is yet to come.
