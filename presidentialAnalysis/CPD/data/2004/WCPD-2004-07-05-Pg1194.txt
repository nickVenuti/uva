Statement on Signing Legislation To Provide for the Transfer of the 
Nebraska Avenue Naval Complex

July 2, 2004

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 4322, ``An Act to provide for the 
transfer of the Nebraska Avenue Naval Complex in the District of 
Columbia to facilitate the establishment of the headquarters for the 
Department of Homeland Security, to provide for the acquisition by the 
Department of the Navy of suitable replacement facilities, and for other 
purposes.'' This legislation will

allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to consolidate 
headquarters staff at the Complex for the foreseeable future.
    The executive branch shall construe section 1(g)(3) of the Act, 
which purports to make consultation with specified Members of Congress a 
precondition to execution of the law, as calling for, but not mandating, 
such consultation. Construing the provision as a mandate to consult 
would be inconsistent with constitutional provisions concerning the 
separate powers of the Congress to legislate and the President to 
execute the laws.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 July 2, 2004.

Note: H.R. 4322, approved July 2, was assigned Public Law No. 108-268.
