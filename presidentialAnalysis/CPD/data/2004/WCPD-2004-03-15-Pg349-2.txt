Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments for the Department of Defense

March 5, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget 
amendments for the Department of Defense reflecting the Army's 
recommendation not to proceed further with funding for the Comanche 
helicopter program. Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed 
in the FY 2005 Budget would not be affected by these amendments.
    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
