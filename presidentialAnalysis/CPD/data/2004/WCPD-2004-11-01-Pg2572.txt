Statement on the Death of
James Cardinal Hickey

October 24, 2004

    Cardinal James Hickey was an inspirational spiritual leader who 
brought comfort to the sick and help and hope to those in need. He was a 
caring and compassionate man. For 20 years, he led the Archdiocese of 
Washington with great dignity and conviction. He will be deeply missed 
by his church, the Washington community, and all of the people 
throughout America whose lives he touched so deeply. Laura and I send 
our prayers and condolences to his family, friends, and loved ones.
