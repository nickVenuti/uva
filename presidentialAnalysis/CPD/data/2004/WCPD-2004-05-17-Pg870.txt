Execution of Nicholas Berg

    I want to express my condolences to the family and friends of 
Nicholas Berg. Nicholas Berg was an innocent civilian who was in Iraq to 
help build a free Iraq. There is no justification for the brutal 
execution of Nicholas Berg--no justification whatsoever.
    The actions of the terrorists who executed this man remind us of the 
nature of the few people who want to stop the advance of freedom in 
Iraq. Their intention is to shake our will. Their intention is to shake 
our confidence. Yet, by their actions, they remind us of how desperately 
parts of the world need free societies and peaceful societies, and we 
will complete our mission. We will complete our task.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 1 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to American hostage Nicholas Berg, 
who was killed in Iraq in early May by senior Al Qaida associate Abu 
Musab Al Zarqawi.
