Statement on Senate Inaction on Appropriations Legislation

January 20, 2004

    Today a minority in the Senate denied a vote on a spending bill that 
is 4 months overdue and that fulfills important commitments: commitments 
to veterans who need health care; to Africans suffering from AIDS; to 
FBI agents fighting terror; to children learning to read in our Nation's 
public schools. This bill stays within the spending limits I proposed. 
And the Senate needs to pass it.
