Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation To Provide Funding for 
the United States Military

July 22, 2004

    My most solemn duty as President is to protect the lives of the 
American people, and I have worked consistently for the largest defense 
buildup in a generation. America continues to be at war, and the 
legislation passed today by the Congress delivers the funding necessary 
to ensure that our troops are the best paid, the best equipped, and the 
best trained in the world.
    I also commend the Congress for continuing to provide the resources 
necessary to support the critical missions of our troops in Afghanistan 
and Iraq. As I have said repeatedly, our troops will have what they need 
to do their job, and I am pleased that a bipartisan majority in the 
Congress continues to stand with me to support our military.
    I look forward to signing this legislation into law.
