Statement on Signing the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2005

October 29, 2004

    Protecting the American people is my most solemn responsibility, and 
a superior U.S. military is essential to that effort and to fighting and 
winning the global war on terrorism. The Defense Authorization Act of 
2005 will continue to strengthen our security and ensure that our troops 
are the best paid, best trained, and best equipped fighting force in the 
world.
    We have increased military pay by over 20 percent since I came into 
office, and this legislation includes the fourth consecutive pay raise 
for our service men and women. It funds more protective equipment like 
body armor and reinforced Humvees to keep our troops as safe as 
possible.
    This bill also continues the transformation of our military and 
funds the technology and advanced weapons systems we need. And it keeps 
our commitment to our troops, military retirees, reservists, and their 
families by ensuring they get the health, housing, and other benefits 
that they deserve. This bill will help us continue to strengthen our 
all-volunteer military.
