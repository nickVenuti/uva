Message on the Observance of Hanukkah 2004

December 7, 2004

    I send greetings to all those celebrating Hanukkah, the festival of 
lights.
    On the 25th day of Kislev on the Hebrew calendar, Jews around the 
world commemorate the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem more than 
2,000 years ago. During this time of darkness, the Temple had been 
seized, and Judaism had been outlawed. Judah Maccabee and his followers 
fought for three years for their freedom and successfully recaptured 
Jerusalem and the Temple. Jewish tradition teaches that the Maccabees 
found only one small bottle of oil to be used for temple rituals, but 
that oil lasted eight days and nights. The miracle of this enduring 
light, remembered through the lighting of the Menorah, continues to 
symbolize the triumph of faith over tyranny.
    The bravery of the Maccabees has provided inspiration through the 
ages. We must remain steadfast and courageous as we seek to spread peace 
and freedom throughout the world. This holiday season, we give thanks to 
God, and we remember the brave men

and women of our Armed Forces and their families. We also pray that all 
who live under oppression will see their day of freedom and that the 
light of faith will always shine through the darkness.
    Laura joins me in wishing you a blessed and Happy Hanukkah.
                                                George W. Bush
