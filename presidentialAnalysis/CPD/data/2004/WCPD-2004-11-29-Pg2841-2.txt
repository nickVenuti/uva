Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget amendment 
for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program in the Department of

contingency funding for this program as an emergency requirement.
    The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
