Message to the Congress Transmitting a Notice of Intention To Enter Into 
a Free Trade Agreement With Bahrain

June 15, 2004

To the Congress of the United States:

    Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002, 
(Public Law 107-210; the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the 
Congress of my intent to enter into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with 
the Government of Bahrain.
    This agreement will create new opportunities for America's workers, 
farmers, businesses, and consumers by eliminating barriers in trade with 
Bahrain. Entering into an FTA with Bahrain will not only strengthen our 
bilateral ties with this important ally, it will also advance my goal of 
a U.S.-Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) by 2013.
    Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at 
least 90 days in advance of signing the United States-Bahrain FTA. My 
Administration looks forward to

working with the Congress in developing appropriate legislation to 
approve and implement this free trade agreement.
