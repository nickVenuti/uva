Message to the Congress Transmitting a Determination on Trade With 
Belarus

June 3, 2004

To the Congress of the United States:

    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974 (the ``Act''), as amended, with respect to the 
continuation of a waiver of application of subsections (a) and (b) of 
section 402 of the Act to the Republic of Belarus. This document 
constitutes my recommendation to continue this waiver for a further 12-
month period and includes my determination that continuation of the 
waiver currently in effect for Belarus will substantially promote the 
objectives of section 402 of the Act, and my reasons for such 
determination.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 June 3, 2004.
