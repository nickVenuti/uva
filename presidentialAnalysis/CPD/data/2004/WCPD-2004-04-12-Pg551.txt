Message on the Observance of Passover, 5764

April 5, 2004

    I send greetings to those observing Passover, beginning at sundown 
on April 5.
    Freedom is God's gift to every man and woman. During Passover, 
Jewish people celebrate their historic liberation from slavery. This 
joyous eight-day observance is testimony to the power of good to 
overcome evil and is an opportunity for Jews to share the message of 
God's mercy. By reading the Haggadah, which tells the story of the 
Exodus and explains the traditional Passover Seder, Jewish children 
learn about their proud heritage and the importance of faith, courage, 
endurance, and love.
    Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a Happy Passover.
                                                George W. Bush
