Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on the Squirrel River in 
Alaska

November 17, 2004

To the Congress of the United States:

    I transmit herewith the enclosed study, findings, and report for the 
Squirrel River in Alaska. The report and my recommendations are 
submitted pursuant to my authority under Article II, section 3, of the 
Constitution of the United States, and consistent with section 5(a) of 
the Wild and Scenic Rivers (WSR) Act, Public Law 90-542, as amended. The 
Squirrel River suitability study was authorized by Public Law 96-487 
(Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act).
    The study conducted by the Bureau of Land Management determined that 
all 100 miles of the river are nonsuitable for inclusion in the National 
WSR System. Consistent with the study, I recommend that the Congress 
take no action to designate the river. The withdrawal provided by 
section 5(a) of the WSR Act would expire within 3 years of the date of 
this message (unless other action is taken by the Congress). 
Approximately 81,501 acres of State-selected lands would be opened to 
mineral entry although mineral potential has been assessed as very low 
and there are no past or active mining claims.
                                                George W. Bush
