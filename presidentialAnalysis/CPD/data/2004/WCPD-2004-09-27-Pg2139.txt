Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Budget Amendment for the Department of Energy

September 24, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget amendment 
for the Department of Energy. This amendment replaces a previous 
amendment transmitted September 7, 2004, and would not increase the 
discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2005 Budget.
    The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
