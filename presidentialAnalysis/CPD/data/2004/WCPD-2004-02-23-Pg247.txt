recommendation of the Department of Commerce, I certify that for 
calendar year 2003:
            In connection with Condition 9, Protection of Advanced 
            Biotechnology, the legitimate commercial activities and 
            interests of chemical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical 
            firms in the United States were not harmed significantly by 
            the limitations of the Convention on access to, and 
            production of, those chemicals and toxins listed in Schedule 
            1 of the Annex on Chemicals.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
