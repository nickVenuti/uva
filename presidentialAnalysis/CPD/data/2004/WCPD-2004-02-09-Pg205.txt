Remarks to Reporters at the National Targeting Center in 
Reston, Virginia

February 6, 2004

    I'm glad I came here to the National Targeting Center. This is a 
building full of modern technology and hard-working people. People here 
are working incredibly long hours to better secure the homeland, and I 
am here to thank them for their service to our country.
    A lot of our citizens really don't know the extent to which our 
Government and many of the employees are really working hard. Here I've 
learned--I've seen how we are able to mate information with terrorist 
lists or information with potentially dangerous cargo so we can spread 
valuable information throughout the country at ports of entry or border 
crossings.
    It's a fascinating place. It's a place where after 9/11 we grew, 
grew with getting the very best programs and programmers and computers 
to keep us better protected. I really want to thank the people here.

    On another front, I'm pleased, obviously, with the new job growth. I 
have been saying that this economy looks pretty strong, and today 
112,000 new jobs were created last month--a report that 112,000 new jobs 
were created last month. And that's good. Things are getting better. 
There is more to do, but this economy is growing in strength, and I'm 
obviously pleased with that.
    Thank you all for coming.

Note: The President spoke at 2:45 p.m.
