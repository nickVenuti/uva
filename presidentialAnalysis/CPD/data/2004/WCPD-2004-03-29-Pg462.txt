Message to the Congress Transmitting Notice of Intention To Enter Into a 
Free Trade Agreement With the Dominican Republic

March 24, 2004

To the Congress of the United States:

    Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002 
(Public Law 107-210; the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the 
Congress of my intent to enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with 
the Government of the Dominican Republic.
    This agreement will create new opportunities for America's workers, 
farmers, businesses, and consumers by eliminating barriers to trade with 
the Dominican Republic, the largest economy in the Caribbean Basin. At 
the same time, it will help bring to the Dominican Republic expanded 
economic freedom and opportunity, and it will provide an opportunity for 
regional stability, democracy, and economic development through closer 
ties of commerce, investment, and friendship.
    Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at 
least 90 days in advance of entering into an agreement with the 
Dominican Republic. My Administration looks forward to working with the 
Congress in developing appropriate legislation to approve and implement 
this free trade agreement.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 March 24, 2004.
