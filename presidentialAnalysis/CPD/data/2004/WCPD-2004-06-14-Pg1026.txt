Proclamation 7792--D-Day National Remembrance Day, 2004

 June 5, 2004

 By the President of the United States

 of America

 A Proclamation

    Sixty years ago, the soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the Allied 
Expeditionary Force invaded Normandy in northern France to open a new 
front in our war against Nazism and tyranny. The courage of these troops 
turned the tide of World War II and changed the fate of the world 
forever. Their extraordinary service in the face of great danger 
demonstrated the finest qualities of our Nation and of our Allies, and 
millions around the world today live in freedom because of their 
sacrifice. By remembering the heroic actions of our Armed Forces at 
Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword beaches in 1944, we honor a 
generation who served this country and saved liberty for people 
everywhere.
    Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 6, 2004, as D-Day National Remembrance 
Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this occasion with appropriate 
activities, ceremonies and programs designed to honor those who served 
and sacrificed to liberate Europe and defend America's freedom and 
security.
    In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.
                                                George W. Bush
