Statement on Senate Action To Block a Constitutional Amendment on 
Marriage

July 14, 2004

    I am deeply disappointed that the effort to pass a constitutional 
amendment affirming the sanctity of marriage as being between a man and 
a woman was temporarily blocked in the Senate.
    Activist judges and local officials in some parts of the country are 
not letting up in their efforts to redefine marriage for the rest of 
America--and neither should defenders of traditional marriage flag in 
their efforts.
    It is important for our country to continue the debate on this 
important issue, and I urge the House of Representatives to pass this 
amendment.
