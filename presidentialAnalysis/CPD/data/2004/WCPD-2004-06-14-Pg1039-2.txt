    Thank you all very much for working at what you're doing. It's a 
great example of Federal, State, and local cooperation. I appreciate so 
many of you taking time away from your families to make sure this event 
goes the way we want it to go, secure and peaceful.
    I know that you're working long hours, and I've come to thank you 
very much for what you're doing. It means a lot to me, and it means a 
lot to the people whose lives you're protecting.
    So I want to thank you very much, and I ask for God's blessings on 
you all and the country. Thank you very much.
