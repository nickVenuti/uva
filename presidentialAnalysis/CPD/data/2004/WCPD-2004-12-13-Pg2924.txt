Statement on the Resignation of Anthony J. Principi as Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs

December 8, 2004

    As a valuable member of my Cabinet, Tony Principi has served as a 
tireless advocate for 25 million veterans. He has insisted on results, 
and he has gotten results. Under Tony's leadership, we have honored our 
veterans for their service and sacrifice by increasing and improving 
health care services, working to eliminate the waiting list for medical 
care, and cutting the disability claims backlog. I appreciate his 
efforts to improve access to health care for low-income veterans and 
those with service-related disabilities. As we fight the war on terror, 
Tony has played a vital role in helping to streamline the transition 
from military to civilian status for our newest veterans.
    I thank Tony for serving our veterans and our country with integrity 
and dignity. He is a good man and a good friend. I am grateful to Tony, 
Liz, and the entire Principi family.

 Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also made available Secretary 
Principi's letter of resignation.
