and steady leader of the Department of Energy. He helped develop our 
National Energy Policy to reduce our country's reliance on foreign 
sources of energy and to provide reliable, affordable, and 
environmentally sound energy for America's future. He launched new 
technological research initiatives that will lead to the next generation 
of pollution-free automobiles and clean coal powerplants. In the war on
