Message on the Observance of
Rosh Hashanah, 5765

September 14, 2004

    I send greetings to all those celebrating Rosh Hashanah.
    On this holy occasion, Jews throughout the world celebrate the 
beginning of a New Year. In synagogues and homes, Jewish families 
reflect on the year that has passed, and look forward to the year to 
come. Jewish tradition teaches that on Rosh Hashanah, God holds open the 
Book of Life to all who approach Him in prayer. As you gather to pray, 
may God grant your prayers for a peaceful New Year.
    As you share in the traditional festivities of this special time of 
year, you renew your commitment to acts of compassion, and to the cause 
of freedom around the world. Together, all of us are helping to build a 
world filled with the blessings of family, health, and peace.
    Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a blessed Rosh 
Hashanah and a sweet New Year.
                                                George W. Bush
