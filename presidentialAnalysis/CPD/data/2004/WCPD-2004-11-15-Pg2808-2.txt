Statement on the Resignation of John Ashcroft as Attorney General

November 9, 2004

    John Ashcroft has worked tirelessly to help make our country safer. 
During his 4 years at the Department of Justice, John has transformed 
the Department to make combating terrorism the top priority, including 
making sure our law enforcement officials have the tools they need to 
disrupt and prevent attacks. In doing so, he has made sure that the 
rights of Americans are respected and protected.
    I applaud his efforts to prevent crime, vigorously enforce our civil 
rights laws, crack down on corporate wrongdoing, protect the rights of 
victims and those with disabilities, reduce crimes committed with guns, 
and stop human trafficking. I appreciate his work to fight Internet 
pornography. I am grateful for

his advice on judicial nominations and his efforts to ensure that my 
judicial nominees receive fair hearings and timely votes.
    John has served our Nation with honor, distinction, and integrity. I 
appreciate his service and wish him and Janet all the best.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also made available Attorney 
General Ashcroft's letter of resignation.
