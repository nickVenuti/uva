Remarks on Arrival in South Bend, Indiana

May 3, 2004

    I am proud to be standing by the side of my friend Mitch Daniels. 
Mitch is going to be the Governor of the State of Indiana, and I know 
for certain the people of this State will love this guy as their 
Governor. See, I've seen him firsthand. I know what it's like to work 
with Mitch. He's smart. He's capable. He's well organized. He's got a 
fabulous sense of humor.
    I gave him a lot of tough jobs, and he did each of them with great 
professionalism and class. I know the people are going to the polls 
tomorrow in the primary. I'm not a voter in this State, Mitch, but if I 
were, I'd be voting for you, because I'll know you'll be a great 
Governor.
    Do you want to say something?

Note: The President spoke at 11:58 a.m. at South Bend Regional Airport. 
The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also
