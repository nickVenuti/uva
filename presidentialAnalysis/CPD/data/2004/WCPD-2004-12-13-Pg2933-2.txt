to the Congress on whether to continue a specified pilot project beyond 
its statutory expiration date, which would require enactment of 
legislation. Section 4332 of title 38, as amended by section 202 of the 
Act, purports to require officials in the executive branch to submit 
recommendations for legislative action in certain circumstances. The 
executive branch shall implement these provisions in a manner consistent 
with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary 
executive branch and to recommend for the consideration of the Congress 
such measures as the President judges necessary and expedient.
