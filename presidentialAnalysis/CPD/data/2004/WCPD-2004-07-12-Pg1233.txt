Remarks in Pottstown, Pennsylvania

July 9, 2004

    Thank you all very much for coming out to say hello. I'm honored to 
be here. I'm here to ask for your vote. I'm campaigning because I want 
America to be a safer place, a stronger place, and a better place.
    It's such an honor to be in the great State of Pennsylvania, and 
it's such an honor to represent the greatest country on the face of the 
Earth. Thanks for coming out to say hello. May God bless you all, and 
may God continue to bless the United States of America.
