Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa 2004

December 23, 2004

    I send greetings to those observing Kwanzaa.
    During Kwanzaa, millions of African Americans and people of African 
descent gather to celebrate their heritage and ancestry. Kwanzaa 
celebrations provide an opportunity to focus on the importance of 
family, community, and history, and to reflect on the Nguzo Saba or 
seven principles of African culture. These principles emphasize unity, 
self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative 
economics, purpose, creativity, and faith.

    Kwanzaa strengthens the ties that bind communities across America 
and around the world and reflects the great promise and diversity of 
America.
    Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a joyous Kwanzaa.
                                                George W. Bush
