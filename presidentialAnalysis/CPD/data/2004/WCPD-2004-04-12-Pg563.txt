Message on the Observance of Easter 2004

April 9, 2004

The Lord is risen indeed . . .

                                                    Luke 24:34

    I send greetings to Christians around the world as they gather to 
celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Jesus' life and teachings 
continue to speak to every generation, and Christians believe his 
miraculous Resurrection provides hope for the future and offers us the 
promise of new life.
    Through His ministry and sacrifice, Jesus demonstrated God's 
unconditional love for us. He taught us the importance of helping others 
and loving our neighbors. His selfless devotion and mercy provide a 
remarkable example for all of us.
    As families and friends gather to enjoy this Easter season, we 
celebrate God's gift of freedom and His love that conquers death. For 
those who observe Easter, our faith brings confidence that good will 
overcome

evil and that joy is everlasting. Today, we give thanks for God's many 
blessings and pray for His peace in the affairs of men.
    Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a happy Easter.
                                                George W. Bush
