Gordon Cooper

October 5, 2004

    Gordon Cooper was a pioneer of human space exploration. He was one 
of the original seven Mercury astronauts, logging more than 225 hours in 
space throughout his distinguished career. He also served his country in 
the United States Air Force and received numerous awards including the 
Distinguished Flying Cross. Laura joins me in sending our condolences to 
the entire Cooper family.
