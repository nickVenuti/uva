Terrorist Attack in Spain

    Today I spoke to His Majesty the King of Spain--Jose Maria Aznar as 
well--about our country's deepest sympathies toward those who lost their 
life as a result of terrorist bombings in Spain. I told him we weep with 
the families. We stand strongly with the people of Spain. I appreciate 
so very much the Spanish Government's fight against terror, their 
resolute stand against terrorist organizations like the ETA. The United 
States stands with them. Today we ask God's blessings on those who 
suffer in the great country of Spain.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:51 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to King Juan Carlos I and President 
Jose Maria Aznar of Spain; and Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA).
