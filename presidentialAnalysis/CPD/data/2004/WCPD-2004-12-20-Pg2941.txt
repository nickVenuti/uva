Memorandum on Renewal of Trade Agreement With the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam

December 10, 2004

 Presidential Determination No. 2005-11

Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative

Subject: Renewal of Trade Agreement with the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam

    Pursuant to my authority under subsection 405(b)(1)(B) of the Trade 
Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(b)(1)(B)), I have determined that actual or 
foreseeable reductions in U.S. tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade 
resulting from multilateral negotiations are being satisfactorily 
reciprocated by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. I have further found 
that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has 
been maintained during the life of the Agreement on Trade Relations 
between the United States of America and the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam.
    You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the 
Federal Register.
                                                George W. Bush
