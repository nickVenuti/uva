Statement on Senate Passage of the Proposed ``Individuals With 
Disabilities Education Improvement Act''

May 13, 2004

    I am pleased that the Senate passed the ``Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Improvement Act,'' which would continue to build 
on the great progress we have made in helping children with disabilities 
achieve their full potential. By working together to open doors for 
citizens with disabilities, we can help fulfill the promise of our great 
Nation.
    This legislation will further promote educational opportunities for 
children with disabilities. I am committed to working together with 
students, parents, teachers, schools, and communities to ensure that all 
children are given every chance to learn and to reach their full 
potential, including children with disabilities.
    I urge the House and Senate to meet in a timely manner in order to 
reach agreement on a final legislative package that I can sign into law 
this year.
