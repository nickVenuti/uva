Statement on the Terrorist Attack on the Moscow Subway

February 6, 2004

    I condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack on the Moscow 
subway. I join the American people in grieving for the victims and for 
their families. No cause ever justifies the killing of innocent life. 
The United States stands with Russia in opposing terrorist acts and in 
our determination to bring the perpetrators to justice.
