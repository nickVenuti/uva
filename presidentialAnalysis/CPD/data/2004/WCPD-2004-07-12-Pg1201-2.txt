 A Proclamation

    By the authority vested in me as President of the United States by 
the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in 
honor and tribute to the memory of Ronald Reagan, it is hereby ordered 
that the flag of the United States shall be displayed at full-staff at 
the White House and on all buildings, grounds, and Naval vessels of the 
United States beginning July 3, 2004. I also direct that beginning on 
that same date, the representatives of the United States in foreign 
countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at 
full-staff over their Embassies, Legations, and other facilities abroad, 
including all military facilities and stations.
    In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.
                                                George W. Bush
