Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments

September 7, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget 
amendments for the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, 
and the Corps of Engineers. In total, these amendments would not 
increase the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2005 
Budget.

    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
