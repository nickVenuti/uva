Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation To Reinstate 
the Draft

October 5, 2004

    I applaud the House of Representatives for soundly rejecting the 
``Reinstate the Draft'' bill, sponsored by Congressman Rangel in the 
House and Senator Hollings in the Senate. If this bill were presented to 
me, I would veto it. America's all-volunteer military is the best in the 
world, and reinstating the draft would be bad policy. We have increased 
pay and benefits to ensure that our troops have the resources they need 
to fight and win the war on terror. I want every American to understand 
that, as long as I am President, there will be no draft.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 163.
