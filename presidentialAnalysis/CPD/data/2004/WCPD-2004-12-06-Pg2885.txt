Statement on the Resignation of
Tom Ridge as Secretary of
Homeland Security

November 30, 2004

    Tom Ridge has been a key member of my Cabinet, working to help make 
America safer and stronger. As the Nation's first Assistant to the 
President for Homeland Security and first Secretary of Homeland 
Security, he oversaw the most extensive reorganization of the Federal 
Government in 50 years. His efforts have resulted in safer skies, 
increased border and port security, and enhanced measures to safeguard 
our critical infrastructure and the American public. In the fight 
against terrorism, he has played a vital role in protecting the American 
people from a real and ongoing threat.
    Tom has served America for decades, including as a decorated Army 
soldier, as a United States Congressman, and as Governor of 
Pennsylvania. He is a long-time friend, and I thank him for his 
leadership and dedicated service to our country. America is safer and 
our Government is better able to protect our people because of his hard 
work. I wish him and Michele all the best.

 Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also made available Secretary 
Ridge's letter of resignation.
