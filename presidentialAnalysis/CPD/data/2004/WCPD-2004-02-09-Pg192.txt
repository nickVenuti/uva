Statement on Representative
W.J. Tauzin's Decision Not To Seek Reelection

February 4, 2004

    Billy Tauzin has always been a friend to American consumers and 
seniors as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is a 
strong leader and a good friend, and we will miss his experience and 
sense of humor. Laura and I wish Billy and Cecile the best.
