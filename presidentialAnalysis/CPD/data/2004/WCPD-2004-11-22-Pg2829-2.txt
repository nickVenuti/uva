Statement on the Resignation of
Ed Gillespie as Chairman of the Republican National Committee

November 15, 2004

    Ed Gillespie has done an outstanding job as chairman of the 
Republican National Committee. He helped bring many new people to our 
cause by sharing our vision of a safer world and more hopeful America. 
His successful efforts in outreach, registration, and voter turnout will 
be an enduring legacy on which to build a long-lasting governing 
coalition.
    Republicans now hold the Presidency, majorities in both Houses of 
Congress, and the majority of governorships and State legislatures. 
That's due to a lot of hard work by many people, and one of the most 
important contributions has been the personal commitment, creativity, 
and leadership of Ed Gillespie these past years.
    I thank Ed for his exceptional service and friendship and wish him 
and Cathy all the best.
