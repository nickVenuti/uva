 Presidential Determination No. 2004-38

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

Subject: Determination Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and 
Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as Amended

    Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance 
Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that 
it is important to the national interest that up to $34 million be made 
available from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund 
to meet unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs, including those 
of refugees, displaced persons, conflict victims, and other persons at 
risk, from the crises in the West Bank and Gaza, Sudan, and Chad. These 
funds may be used, as appropriate, to provide contributions to 
international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, and, as 
necessary, for administrative expenses of the Bureau of Population, 
Refugees, and Migration.
    You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees 
of the Congress of this determination and the obligation of funds under 
this authority, and to arrange for the publication of this memorandum in 
the Federal Register.
                                                George W. Bush
