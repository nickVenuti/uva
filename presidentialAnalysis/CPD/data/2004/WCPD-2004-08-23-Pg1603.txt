Statement on the Death of 
Julia Child

August 13, 2004

    Julia Child enriched America with her optimism and enthusiasm for 
life. She worked with the Office of Strategic Services to protect 
freedom during World War II. She taught millions to enjoy cooking, and 
her legacy will continue through her books and videos. She was a pioneer 
in the early television age who made great strides for women. For her 
many contributions, she was honored in 2003 with the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom, the Nation's highest civil honor. Laura and I send our 
prayers and condolences to her family and friends.
