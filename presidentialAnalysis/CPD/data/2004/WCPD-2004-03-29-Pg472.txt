Statement on Senate Passage of the ``Unborn Victims of Violence Act''

March 25, 2004

    I applaud the Senate for passing the ``Unborn Victims of Violence 
Act'' today by a strong bipartisan vote. We must continue to build a 
culture of life in our country, a compassionate society in which every 
child is welcomed in life and protected by law.
    Pregnant women who have been harmed by violence, and their families, 
know that there are two victims--the mother and the unborn child--and 
both victims should be protected by Federal law.
    I look forward to signing this important legislation into law.
