 Statement Calling for a Constitutional Amendment Defining and 
Protecting Marriage

 May 17, 2004

     The sacred institution of marriage should not be redefined by a few 
activist judges. All Americans have a right to be heard in this debate. 
I called on the Congress to pass and to send to the States for 
ratification an amendment to our Constitution defining and protecting 
marriage as a union of a man and a woman as husband and wife. The need 
for that amendment is still urgent, and I repeat that call today.
