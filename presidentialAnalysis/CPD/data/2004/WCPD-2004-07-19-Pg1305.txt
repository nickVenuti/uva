Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments

July 14, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget 
amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human 
Services, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, and Labor. In 
addition, I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2004 language 
proposal for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Overall, 
the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2005 budget would 
not be increased by these requests.
    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
