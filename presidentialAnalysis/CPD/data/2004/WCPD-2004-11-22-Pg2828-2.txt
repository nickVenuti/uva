Statement on the Resignation of Roderick R. Paige as Secretary of 
Education

November 15, 2004

    Rod Paige has been at the forefront of fundamentally reforming and 
improving our Nation's public education system so that no child is left 
behind in America. His passion for taking on the status quo and fighting 
for reform underscores his strong commitment to our country's young 
people and his desire to give them a brighter future. Throughout his 
life, Rod has overcome great obstacles and achieved great success. He 
represents the best of America.
    We have only begun the long-term transformation of education so that 
future generations can enjoy all of the promise and opportunity America 
has to offer. Thanks to the hard work of Rod Paige, we have a very 
strong start and are well on our way to fulfilling that promise.
    I am thankful for Rod's leadership during this important time and am 
grateful for his friendship. I wish him all the best.

 Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also made available Secretary 
Paige's letter of resignation.
