Statement on Senate Action
on the Proposed ``Internet Tax
Nondiscrimination Act''

April 29, 2004

    I commend the Senate for moving forward to expand access to 
broadband technology. The ``Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act'' is an 
important step toward permanently banning access taxes on broadband that 
will help make high-speed Internet services more affordable, increase 
the number of broadband users, and enhance our Nation's economic 
competitiveness.
