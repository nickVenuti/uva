Statement on the National Economy

May 28, 2004

    One year ago today, I signed into law the jobs and growth tax relief 
package to jump-start the economic recovery and create jobs for American 
workers. With our economy growing at the fastest pace in nearly 20 years 
and more than 1.1 million more Americans working since last August, it 
is clear the tax relief is working.
    Take-home pay for workers is up, and disposable income for families 
has increased to record levels. The incentives in our plan for small 
businesses are producing results as more manufacturers have been 
reporting increased activity and new orders than at any time in 20 
years. I am encouraged to see that the unemployment rate has fallen in 
47 of 50 States, because we want everyone who wants to work to be able 
to find a job.
    There is more to do. We must continue to build on this success by 
expanding growth and increasing prosperity for all Americans. I look 
forward to working with Congress to pass my six-point plan for economic 
growth, including making the tax cuts permanent,

changing world.
