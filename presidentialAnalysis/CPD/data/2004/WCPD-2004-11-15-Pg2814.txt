Statement on the Death of 
Yasser Arafat

November 10, 2004

    The death of Yasser Arafat is a significant moment in Palestinian 
history. We express our condolences to the Palestinian people. For the 
Palestinian people, we hope that the future will bring peace and the 
fulfillment of their aspirations for an independent, democratic 
Palestine that is at peace with its neighbors. During the period of 
transition that is ahead, we urge all in the region and throughout the 
world to join in helping make progress toward these goals and toward the 
ultimate goal of peace.
