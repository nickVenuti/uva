Memorandum on the 2004 Combined Federal Campaign

September 6, 2004

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: 2004 Combined Federal Campaign

    I am delighted that the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, Michael O. Leavitt, has agreed to serve as the Chair 
of the 2004 Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) of the National Capital 
Area. I ask you to enthusiastically support the CFC by personally 
chairing the campaign in your Agency and appointing a top official as 
your Vice Chair.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. Public servants not 
only contribute to the campaign but also assume leadership roles to 
ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help positively influence 
thousands of employees and will guarantee another successful campaign.
                                                George W. Bush
