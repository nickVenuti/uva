Statement on Signing the NASA Flexibility Act of 2004

February 24, 2004

    Today, I have signed into law S. 610, the ``NASA Flexibility Act of 
2004.'' The Act strengthens the ability of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration to manage effectively the NASA personnel upon whom 
the future successes of America's civil space program depend.
    Section 3 of the Act enacts new subsections 9802(g), (h), and (i) in 
title 5 of the United States Code, which purport to require or regulate 
the submission of certain plans, recommendations, and budget requests to 
the Congress. The executive branch shall construe these subsections in a 
manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to 
supervise the unitary executive branch, to withhold information the 
disclosure of which could impair the deliberative processes of the 
Executive, and to recommend for the consideration of the Congress such 
measures as the President judges necessary and expedient.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 February 24, 2004.

Note: S. 610, approved February 24, was assigned Public Law No. 108-201.
