amended (22 U.S.C. 2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Brazil, 
that: (1) interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily 
engaged in illicit drug trafficking in that country's airspace is 
necessary because of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug 
trafficking to the national security of that country; and (2) that 
country has appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent 
loss of life in the air and on the ground in connection with such 
interdiction, which shall at a minimum include effective means to 
identify and warn an aircraft before the use of force is directed 
against the aircraft.
    The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this 
determination in the Federal Register and to notify the Congress of this 
determination.
                                                George W. Bush
