Message to the Congress Transmitting a Notification of Intent To 
Designate Iraq as a Beneficiary Developing Country for Purposes of the 
Generalized System of Preferences

September 7, 2004

To the Congress of the United States:

    Pursuant to section 502(f) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 
``1974 Act''), I am writing to inform you of my intent to designate Iraq 
as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the Generalized 
System of Preferences (GSP).
    I have considered the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502 of 
the 1974 Act. In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is 
appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Iraq.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 September 7, 2004.
