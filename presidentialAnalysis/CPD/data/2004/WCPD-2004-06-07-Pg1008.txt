Remarks on the Resignation of George J. Tenet as Director of Central 
Intelligence

June 3, 2004

    Today George Tenet, the Director of the CIA, submitted a letter of 
resignation. I met with George last night in the White House. I had a 
good visit with him. He told me he was resigning for personal reasons. I 
told him I'm sorry he's leaving. He's done a superb job on behalf of the 
American people. I accepted his letter. He will serve at the CIA as the 
Director until mid-July, at which time the Deputy Director of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, John McLaughlin, will serve as the Acting 
Director.
    George Tenet is the kind of public service you like--servant you 
like to work with. He's strong. He's resolute. He served his Nation as 
the Director for 7 years. He has been a strong and able leader at the 
Agency. He's been a strong leader in the war on terror, and I will miss 
him. I send my blessings to George and his family. I look forward to 
working with him until the time he leaves the Agency. And I wish him all 
the very best.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:26 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House.
