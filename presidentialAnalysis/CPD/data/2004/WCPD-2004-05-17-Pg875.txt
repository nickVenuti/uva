Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Budget Amendment To Establish a Contingent Emergency Reserve Fund To 
Support Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan

May 12, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget amendment 
to establish a $25 billion contingent emergency reserve fund to support 
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
    Although we do not know the precise costs for operations next year, 
developments on the ground in Iraq indicate the need to plan for 
contingencies. We plan to pursue a full FY 2005 supplemental request 
when we can better estimate precise costs. In the meantime, this reserve 
fund will ensure that our men and women in uniform continue to have the 
resources they need when they need them.
    I have pledged to our troops that they will have all the resources 
they need to accomplish this vital mission, and I urge the Congress to 
approve this reserve fund.
    The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
    Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
