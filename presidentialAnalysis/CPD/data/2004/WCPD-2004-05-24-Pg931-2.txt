Statement on House of Representatives Passage of 
Budget Legislation

May 20, 2004

    I commend the House of Representatives for passing a responsible 
budget that meets our Nation's highest priorities of winning the war on 
terror, protecting the homeland, and helping our economy continue to 
create new jobs. This budget keeps tax relief flowing to married 
couples, families with children, and working people, while restraining 
overall spending and allowing the deficit to be cut in half in the next 
5 years. I urge the Senate to follow the House's lead and pass this 
budget so that we can continue making progress on our shared agenda of 
building a safer, stronger, and better America.
