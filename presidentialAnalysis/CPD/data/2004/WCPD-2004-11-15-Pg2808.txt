Statement on the Resignation of Donald L. Evans as Secretary of Commerce

November 9, 2004

    Don Evans is one of my most trusted friends and advisers. He has 
been a valuable member of my economic team. Don has worked to advance 
economic security and prosperity for all Americans. He has worked 
steadfastly to make sure America continues to be the best place in the 
world to do business.
    To encourage job creation here at home, Don has worked closely with 
me to reduce taxes, open markets for American goods and services, and 
promote a level playing field abroad.
    Don shares my belief that the promise of America means our best days 
lie ahead. Together, we have worked to make that a reality.
    I thank Don for his outstanding service to our Nation and wish him 
and Susie all the best as they return home to Texas.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also made available Secretary 
Evans' letter of resignation.
