Statement on Senate Passage of the ``National Intelligence Reform Act''

October 6, 2004

    I commend the Senate for acting in a bipartisan way to pass landmark 
legislation that will help us meet our goal to better protect the 
American people by strengthening the intelligence community. The 
``National Intelligence Reform Act'' is consistent with my proposal to 
establish a strong National Intelligence Director with full budget 
authority and the new National Counterterrorism Center. America is a 
nation at war, and this legislation is another important step forward as 
we do everything in our power to defeat the terrorist enemy and protect 
the American people. I urge the House to act quickly so that Congress 
can resolve any differences and send legislation to me as soon as 
possible.

Note: The statement referred to S. 2845.
