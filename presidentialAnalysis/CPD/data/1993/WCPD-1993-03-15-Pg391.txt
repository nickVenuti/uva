Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With California State 
Legislators

 March 10, 1993

Health Care Task Force

    Q. Mr. President, can your health care task force proceed in public?

    The President. Well, I understand we got a ruling from the judge 
today.

    Q. The judge ruled that the meetings have to be open.

    The President. He's ruled that they had to have some open meetings, 
but in the briefing I got was that he ruled that some of the assertions 
that were made were absolutely unconstitutional. The briefing that I got 
was that we got a very good ruling from the judge today.

Military Base Closings

    Q. Are the bases going to close in California, sir?

    The President. I don't know. We don't know what's going to happen. I 
don't know what--you all have published lists. I've not seen the lists. 
You know how it works: The base closing commission has to make a 
recommendation. Then they give it to me, and I have to evaluate whether 
I think it's right or not. And then, after that, after those two things 
are reconciled, the Congress gets to vote up or down on it. So I don't 
know what's going to happen.

Note: The exchange began at 2:45 p.m., in the State Dining Room at the 
White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
this exchange.
