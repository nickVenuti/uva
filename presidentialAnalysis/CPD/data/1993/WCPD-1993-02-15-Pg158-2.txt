Letter to Congressman William F. Clinger, Jr., on the President's Task 
Force on National Health Care Reform

 February 5, 1993

Dear Congressman Clinger:

    Thank you for your letter of February 1 concerning my health care 
task force. I appreciate your support of my efforts to formulate a 
national health care policy. It is my intention to develop a plan for 
high quality, affordable health care for all Americans, and I have asked 
the health care task force to help me develop legislation for 
comprehensive health care reform.

    I have referred your questions concerning the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act to Bernard Nussbaum, the White House Counsel. Mr. Nussbaum 
has prepared a letter addressing your concerns, which he will deliver to 
you under separate cover. I have also asked Mr. Nussbaum and his staff 
to be available to answer any further questions you may have on legal 
issues relating to the health care task force.
    With best wishes,
    Sincerely,
                                                  Bill Clinton

Note: The President's letter was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary on February 8 but was not issued as a White House press 
release. The White House Counsel's letter was attached to the 
President's letter.
