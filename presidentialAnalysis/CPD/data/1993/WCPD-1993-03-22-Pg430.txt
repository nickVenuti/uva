Statement on Disaster Assistance for Florida

 March 13, 1993

    On March 12 and 13, excessive rainfall, tornadoes, flooding, high 
tides, and gale force winds caused death, serious personal injury, and 
property damage in the State of Florida.
    In a telephone call to me today, Gov. Lawton Chiles requested 
individual assistance and public assistance from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) for Alachua, Citrus, Columbia, Dade, Duval, 
Hamilton, Hendry, Hernando, Hillsborough, Lake, Levy, Manatee, Marion, 
Martin, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Sarasota, Taylor, and Volusia 
Counties.
    The situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective 
response is beyond the capabilities of the State of Florida and local 
governments. Therefore, I concur that supplemental Federal assistance is 
necessary, and FEMA is directed to provide such assistance.
    Individual assistance can include temporary housing, grants, low-
cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to 
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the 
disaster. Public assistance is available to eligible local governments 
on a cost-sharing basis for the repair or replacement of public 
facilities damaged by the flooding.
    Additional areas may be designated at a later date, if requested and 
warranted.
