Statement by Press Secretary Fitzwater on the Situation in Iraq

 January 8, 1993

    We continue to keep the situation in Iraq under close scrutiny. We 
have observed no penetrations by Iraqi aircraft of the No-Fly Zone below 
32 degrees north latitude since Wednesday's coalition warning. The 
disposition of surface-to-air missiles specified in the January 6 
warning is less clear. There has been a good deal of movement involving 
these missiles, but we are still in the process of determining whether 
Iraq is in compliance with the terms of the coalition demarche.
