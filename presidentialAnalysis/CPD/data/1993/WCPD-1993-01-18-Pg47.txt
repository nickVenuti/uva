Statement by Press Secretary Fitzwater on the START II Treaty

 January 15, 1993

    I am pleased to announce that today the President submitted the 
START II treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent to 
ratification. This treaty marks an achievement of fundamental importance 
not only to the United States and Russia but to the whole world. START 
II is the capstone of a process over the past 2 years that has set back 
the hands on the nuclear doomsday clock.

    The President urges the Senate to act promptly and approve the START 
II treaty. He also looks forward to prompt ratification of this treaty 
by Russia, as well as the ratification of START I and accession to the 
nonproliferation treaty by Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Once these 
actions are completed the historic reductions can begin without delay.
