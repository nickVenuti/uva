Nomination of June Gibbs Brown To Be Inspector General of the Department 
of Health and Human Services

 April 1, 1993

    The President announced today that he will nominate June Gibbs 
Brown, a former Inspector General at the Department of Defense, NASA, 
and the Department of the Interior, to be Inspector General of the 
Department of Health and Human Services.
    ``HHS is the biggest civilian Agency of the Federal Government,'' 
said the President, ``and it is imperative that it be managed as 
efficiently as possible. That is one of the central tasks that Secretary 
Shalala has taken on, and I am very pleased to be nominating someone of 
June Gibbs Brown's stature as Inspector General.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
