    The President announced today that he intends to appoint three 
individuals, Jerry MacArthur Hultin, Raymond J. McClendon, and James B.

Congress in 1970 which supports home ownership and rental housing 
through the creation and development of a secondary market for 
residential mortgages.

of financial management experience to the task of overseeing the 
important work of Freddie Mac,'' said the President. ``I appreciate 
their willingness to serve.''
