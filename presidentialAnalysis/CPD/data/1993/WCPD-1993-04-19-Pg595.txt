Statement by the Director of Communications on the President's Federal 
Income Tax Return

 April 15, 1993

    The President and Mrs. Clinton's 1992 tax return shows that they 
have paid $70,228 in Federal income tax on an adjusted gross income of 
$290,697, of which $34,527 was the President's salary as Governor of 
Arkansas and $203,172 was income from Mrs. Clinton's partnership in the 
Rose Law Firm. The remaining income was from interest, dividend, and 
partnership income, capital gains, and Mrs. Clinton's directors fees and 
honoraria.
    The Clintons claimed $39,190 in itemized deductions, which included 
$19,452 in contributions to charities. A list of charitable 
contributions over $500 is attached.
    The Clintons showed capital gains of $16,336, principally from the 
sale of Mrs. Clinton's interest in the Rose Building Limited 
Partnership, which owns the Rose Law Firm's building ($13,199).
    The Clintons sent a check for $4,085 with their tax return, which 
will be mailed today to the Philadelphia Regional Office of the Internal 
Revenue Service.

Note: The President and Mrs. Clinton's joint tax return was made 
available by the Office of the Press Secretary.
