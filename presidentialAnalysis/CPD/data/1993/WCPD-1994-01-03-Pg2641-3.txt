Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa

 December 29, 1993

    I take great pleasure in extending warm greetings to all who are 
observing the festival of Kwanzaa during this holiday season.
    While Kwanzaa has only been celebrated for a quarter century in our 
country, it has grown steadily each year, inviting more people to 
embrace their African heritage. Today, millions of people of African 
descent gather together with loved ones to enjoy this special holiday 
based on the rich cultural traditions of Africa.
    At a time when we are seeking ways to revitalize our neighborhoods 
and empower those who have been powerless for too long, Kwanzaa 
encourages us to rebuild and gives us the opportunity to celebrate the 
strengths of the African American community. The seven principles of 
Kwanzaa--unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, 
cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith--provide young 
people with the pride, direction, and inner strength to work for a 
brighter future.
    On each of the seven days, from Umoja to Imani, I wish all those who 
are commemorating Kwanzaa a wonderful holiday season of hope and joy.
                                                  Bill Clinton
