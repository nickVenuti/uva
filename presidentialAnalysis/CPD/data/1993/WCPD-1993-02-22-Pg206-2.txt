Energy Tax

    Q. Mr. President, if I could ask a specific question. What is----
    The President. ----I thought specific--[laughter].
    Q. You don't have to get into too much detail, but from your 
perspective what's more progressive, a broad-based energy tax based on 
BTU's or an ad valorem-type of energy tax? What would be more 
progressive for the middle class?
    The President. Well, I think, first of all, it's hard to--you can't 
evaluate one of these things without seeing the whole package. But I 
think a BTU tax is, because an ad valorem tax reinforces price changes. 
In other words, if you have an ad valorem tax and the price of one fuel 
goes up, then the tax rate goes up. So, it would aggravate whatever 
price changes are out there in the market, and that would hurt the 
consumers more.

     Q.  Have you settled on a BTU tax?
    The President.  I answered a very specific question in a photo op.
