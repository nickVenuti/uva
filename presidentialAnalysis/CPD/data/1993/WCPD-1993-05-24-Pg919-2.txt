Statement on the Death of Four Marines in the VH-60 Helicopter Crash

 May 20, 1993

    I am greatly saddened by the news of the death of four Marine 
servicemen in the helicopter crash yesterday. Hillary's and my thoughts 
and prayers are with the loved ones of these dedicated airmen. I am sure 
I speak for all Americans in expressing our Nation's deepest 
condolences.
