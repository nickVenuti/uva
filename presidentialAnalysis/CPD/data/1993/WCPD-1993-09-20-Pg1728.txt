Subject: Presidential Determination of the Proposed Agreement Between 
the United States of America and the Republic of Bulgaria for 
Cooperation in the Field of Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy

    I have considered the proposed Agreement Between the Government of 
the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of
