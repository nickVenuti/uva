Statement on the Death of Cesar Chavez

 April 23, 1993

    The labor movement and all Americans have lost a great leader with 
the death today of Cesar Chavez. An inspiring fighter for the cause to 
which he dedicated his life, Cesar Chavez was an authentic hero to 
millions of people throughout the world.
    I share the sadness his family, friends, followers, and supporters 
all feel upon his passing away. We can be proud of his enormous 
accomplishments and the dignity and comfort he brought to the lives of 
so many of our country's least powerful and most dispossessed workers. 
He had a profound impact upon the people of the United States. My 
deepest sympathies go out to all his loved ones.
