With the Joint Chiefs of Staff

    The President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff had a cordial, honest, 
and respectful meeting. They covered a range of issues but focused

    The President reiterated his commitment to ending discrimination 
against homosexuals in the military solely on the basis of status and to 
maintaining morale and cohesion in the military.
    The Joint Chiefs of Staff expressed their concerns and difficulties 
with the President's commitment but also expressed their respect for his 
decisionmaking power as Commander in Chief.
