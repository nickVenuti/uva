Statement on Emergency Assistance to Earthquake Victims in India

 October 1, 1993

    The people of the United States are shocked and saddened by the 
devastating earthquake that has taken thousands of lives and left 
thousands more homeless. I have directed our Government to take 
immediate action to help ease the suffering. I have also asked 
Ambassador Ray Flynn to accompany the supplies, to assess the situation, 
and report back to me.

Note: The President's statement was included in a White House statement 
announcing that the President had directed the Defense Department and 
U.S. Agency for International Development to provide humanitarian 
assistance to earthquake victims in India. This item was not received in
