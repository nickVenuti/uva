To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit 
herewith an Agreement between the Government of the United States of 
America and the Government of the Republic of Latvia Concerning 
Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, with annex, signed at 
Washington on April 8, 1993. The agreement constitutes a governing 
international fishery agreement within the requirements of Section 
201(c) of the Act.
    United States fishing industry interests have urged prompt 
consideration of this agreement to take advantage of opportunities for 
seasonal cooperative fishing ventures. I recommend that the Congress 
give favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
