Nominations for United States Court of Appeals Judges

 August 7, 1993

    The President yesterday nominated three U.S. Court of Appeals 
judges: Martha Craig Daughtrey for the sixth circuit, Pierre N. Leval 
for the second circuit, and M. Blane Michael for the fourth circuit. In 
addition, the President also announced the nominations of U.S. District 
Court judges for Maryland, South Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, the 
Eastern District of New York, the Eastern District of Virginia, the 
Eastern District of Kentucky, and the Eastern District of Arkansas.
    ``There are few things that I will do that will have more lasting 
effect than the appointment of Federal judges,'' said the President. 
``Along with Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court and the many other 
judges yet to be named, this outstanding group of jurists will change 
the face of the Federal courts and help move our country forward.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
