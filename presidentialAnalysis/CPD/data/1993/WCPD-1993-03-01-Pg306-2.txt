Statement by the Press Secretary on the President's Meeting With United 
Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali

 February 23, 1993

    During their meeting on February 23, the President and the Secretary 
General of the United Nations discussed the role of the U.N. and the 
support of the United States, Somalia, Haiti, and a wide range of other 
issues.
    They also discussed the tragic situation in the former Yugoslavia. 
They agreed on the urgent need for an end to the fighting and the 
violations of international humanitarian law.
    In this regard, the President and the Secretary General urge the 
leaders of the parties involved in the peace talks on Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to come to New York immediately to resume discussions in 
pursuit of an agreement to end the conflict.
    In view of emergency humanitarian needs in Bosnia, the Secretary 
General welcomed the President's explanation of the possible use of 
airdrops into isolated areas that are in critical need of relief and 
cannot be reached at this time by ground. They agreed that such drops 
would be temporary and supplemental to land convoys in accordance with 
existing procedures. The President stressed the United States intention 
to coordinate such operations closely with the United Nations relief 
effort.
