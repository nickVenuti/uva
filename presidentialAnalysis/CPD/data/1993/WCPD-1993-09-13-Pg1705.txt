    President Clinton spoke by phone today with Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
of Germany for about 40 minutes.
    The two leaders discussed a number of bilateral and foreign affairs 
issues. On the Generalized Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the

round by the end of 1993 and undertook to remain in contact throughout 
the autumn for that purpose.
    President Clinton and Chancellor Kohl discussed developments in the 
Middle East, both indicating their deep satisfaction over the prospects 
for historic breakthroughs in ongoing talks. They reviewed progress in 
the political and economic reform process in Russia and discussed their 
efforts to assist that process. They also agreed on the need to 
cooperate on issues related to the former Yugoslavia.
