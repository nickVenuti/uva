Letter to Governor Mike Lowry on Disaster Assistance for Washington

 March 4, 1993

Dear Governor Lowry:

    As requested, I have declared a major disaster under the Robert T. 
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) 
for the State of Washington due to damage resulting from severe storms 
and high winds on January 20-21, 1993. I have authorized Federal relief 
and recovery assistance in the affected area.
    Public Assistance will be provided. Consistent with the requirement 
that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided 
under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 
percent of the total eligible costs in the designated areas.
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency (``FEMA'') will coordinate 
Federal assistance efforts and designate specific areas eligible for 
such assistance. The Federal Coordinating Officer will be Mr. John 
Kainrad of FEMA. He will consult with you and assist in the execution of 
the FEMA-State Disaster Assistance Agreement governing the expenditure 
of Federal Funds.
    Sincerely,
                                                  Bill Clinton
