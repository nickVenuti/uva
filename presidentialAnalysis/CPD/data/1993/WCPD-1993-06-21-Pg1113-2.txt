Message to Congress Transmitting the 1992 Report of the National 
Endowment For the Humanities

 June 18, 1993

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the provisions of the National Foundation on the 
Arts and Humanities Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 959(d)), I 
transmit herewith the 27th Annual Report of the National Endowment for 
the Humanities (NEH) for fiscal year 1992. This report was prepared by, 
and covers activities occurring exclusively during, the previous 
Administration. It does not necessarily reflect the policies or 
priorities of my Administration. The Annual Report for 1993, which I 
will submit next April, will reflect the goals and vision of my 
Administration for the NEH.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
June 18, 1993.
