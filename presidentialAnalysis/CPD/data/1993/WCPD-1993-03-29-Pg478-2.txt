    Q. Mr. President, did you and Mr. Kozyrev reach any kind of 
agreement on the type of aid package that might be most helpful for 
Russia?
    The President. No, we discussed what I was thinking about and what 
our people are working on. And I told him it would be a good and 
specific package, and I was looking forward to having the opportunity to 
discuss it with President Yeltsin.
    Q. Did he give you any encouragement, sir, that the current 
political crisis could be resolved?
    The President. I think he's hopeful.
    Q. Any specifics as to how it might be resolved, sir?
    The President. No, he's been here with me.
