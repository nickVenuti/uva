Notice on Continuation of Iran Emergency

 November 1, 1993

    On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order No. 12170, the President 
declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national 
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted 
by the situation in Iran. Notices of the continuation of this national 
emergency have been transmitted annually by the President to the 
Congress and the Federal Register. The most recent notice appeared in 
the Federal Register on October 28, 1992. Because our relations with 
Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing 
the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is still underway, the 
national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, must continue in 
effect beyond November 14, 1993. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)),
