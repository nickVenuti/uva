Announcement of Ambassador to Canada

 May 27, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to nominate former 
Michigan Governor Jim Blanchard to be the U.S. Ambassador to Canada.
    ``Our relationship with Canada is absolutely vital,'' said the 
President. ``They are our largest trading partner and one of our closest 
neighbors. That's why I am nominating an Ambassador in whom I place such 
a high degree of trust, my good friend Jim Blanchard. With a voice that 
will be clearly heard in both Ottawa and Washington, he will ensure that 
this important relationship continues to be productive for both 
countries.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
