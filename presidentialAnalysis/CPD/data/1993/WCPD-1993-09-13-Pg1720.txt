Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders

 September 10, 1993

Israeli-Palestinian Declaration

    Q. Mr. President, are you going to invite Arafat and Rabin to the 
ceremonies on Monday?
    The President. The parties will decide, as they've made all the 
other decisions, who will come to the ceremony. Whatever their decision 
is is fine with me.
    Q. Can you give us an idea of what the United States is prepared to 
do to help this agreement work?
    The President. I'll be talking a little more about that later, and 
I'll have a statement as soon as this meeting is over. I want to talk to 
the Members here about it first.
    Q. Well, can you give us an idea of what this meeting is all about?
    The President. Well, we're going to brief them on--the Secretary of 
State and I are--about, obviously, our strong support for the agreement, 
what America's responsibilities will be, what our allies and friends 
around the world are interested in doing about it, and where we go from 
here.

Note: The exchange began at 9:18 a.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of
