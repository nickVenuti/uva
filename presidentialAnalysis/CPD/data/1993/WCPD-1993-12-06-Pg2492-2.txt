Statement on Implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement

 December 2, 1993

    I am delighted that, as a result of discussions following up on our 
meeting in Seattle, Canadian Prime Minister Chretien has announced his 
intention to proclaim the NAFTA by January 1, 1994. We look forward to 
the smooth and effective implementation of this historic agreement on 
January 1, so that all three countries can begin to reap the benefits of 
expanded trade, economic growth, and job creation in North America with 
the largest free trade area in the world.
