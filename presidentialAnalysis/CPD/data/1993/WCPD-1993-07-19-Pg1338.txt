Letter to the Speaker of the House on Flood Disaster Assistance

 July 14, 1993

Sir:

    I ask Congress to consider expeditiously the enclosed requests for 
emergency FY 1993 supplemental appropriations. These requests provide 
for emergency expenses arising from the consequences of the recent heavy 
rains and flooding along the Mississippi River, particularly in the 
Upper Midwest. I ask further that the legislation in which these funds 
are provided be kept free of extraneous matters in order that there may 
be a minimum of delay in providing necessary funds to the disaster 
areas.

    I hereby designate the following requests as emergency requirements 
pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 
1985, as amended:

<bullet>    Department of Agriculture, Commodity Credit Corporation, 
            Commodity Credit Corporation fund: $600,000,000;

            Watershed and flood prevention operations: $25,000,000;

            control and coastal emergencies: $45,000,000;

            Planning and Development, Community development grants:
