Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Lithuania-United States 
Fishery Agreement

 January 19, 1993

Dear Mr. President:  (Dear Mr. Speaker:)

    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit 
herewith an Agreement between the Government of the United States of 
America and the Government of the Republic of Lithuania Concerning 
Fisheries off the Coasts of the United States, with annex, signed at 
Washington on November 12, 1992. The agreement constitutes a governing 
international fishery agreement within the requirements of section 
201(c) of the Act.
    U.S. fishing industry interests have urged prompt consideration of 
this agreement to take advantage of opportunities for seasonal 
cooperative fishing ventures. I recommend that the Congress give 
favorable consideration to this agreement at an early date.
    Sincerely,
                                                   George Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on

the House of Representatives, and Dan Quayle, President of the Senate.
