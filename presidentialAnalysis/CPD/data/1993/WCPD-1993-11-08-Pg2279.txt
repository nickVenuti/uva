To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-256; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit 
herewith an Agreement Between the Government of the United States of 
America and the Government of the Republic of Korea Extending the 
Agreement of July 26, 1982, Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the 
United States, as extended and amended. The agreement, which was 
effected by an exchange of notes at Washington on June 11, 1993, and 
October 13, 1993, extends the 1982 agreement to December 31, 1995. The 
exchange of notes together with the 1982 agreement constitute a 
governing international fishery agreement within the requirements of 
section 201(c) of the Act.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Republic of Korea, I
