Statement on the Death of Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster, Jr.

 July 20, 1993

    It was with deep sadness that I learned of the death of Vincent 
Foster, who served ably and with distinction as Deputy White House 
Counsel and was my friend for over 40 years. Hillary and I love his wife 
Lisa and their three children, and we want to draw them close to our 
hearts and keep them in our prayers in this painful moment of grief. His 
family has lost a loving husband and father, America has lost a gifted 
and loyal public servant, and Hillary and I have lost a true and trusted 
friend. My deepest hope is that whatever drew Vince away from us this 
evening, his soul will receive the grace and salvation that his good 
life and good works earned.

Note: Included with this statement was information regarding the 
circumstances of Mr. Foster's death.
