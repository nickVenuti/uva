Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With the National Conference 
of State Legislatures

President Boris Yeltsin of Russia

    Q. Mr. President, do you think Yeltsin's going to survive?
    The President. I think that he is the duly elected President of 
Russia and a genuine democrat, small ``d,'' and that he is leading a 
country that is trying greatly to do two things: one, escape from 
communism into market economics, a world they never lived in before; and 
second, to preserve real democracy. That's a tough job. Pretty hard to 
do here. [Laughter]
    I intend to do what I can to be supportive of that process and to be 
supportive of him while he serves as President of Russia. I don't know 
what else to tell you. I'm not a seer. I don't know what's going to 
happen to him or me tomorrow. I have confidence in him. I want to work 
with him as long as I can.

Attorney-General-Designate Janet Reno

    Q. What about Janet Reno?
    The President. I'm elated by that. I told--I had some Senators in 
the office, and I said, that may be the only vote I carry 98 to 0 this 
year. [Laughter] She's a very good person, and I think she will do well.
    Q. When is she going to be sworn in?
    The President. When?
    Q. When?
    The President. Soon, I hope. I've been waiting for someone to--
[laughter].
