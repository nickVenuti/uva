    Q. Mr. President, when do you want campaign's finance reforms to go 
into effect?

    The President. We're here to talk about what's going to be in the 
bill. I want to pass a bill early this year, as early as we can, and 
we're going to talk about that.

    There was a good bill last year--it had a lot of good features in 
it--which was vetoed by President Bush. And I guess we'll start talking 
about that and see where we go from there. But I hope we can get a good 
bill.

    In terms of when it goes into effect, and the last bill skipped an 
election cycle and was widely applauded by all the public interest 
groups as a great advance over where we are now. I think when it goes 
into effect is a subject of discussion here. But I want to pass a good 
bill. That's my concern.

Note: The President spoke at 3:49 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House.
