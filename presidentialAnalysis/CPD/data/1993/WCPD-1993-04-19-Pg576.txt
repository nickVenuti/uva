    The President will nominate Jolene Molitoris to be the Administrator

Ms. Molitoris served for more than a decade with the Ohio Department of 
Transportation and Ohio Rail Transportation Authority.
    ``One of the most important things we can do to improve our overall 
transportation system and to create high-wage manufacturing jobs is to 
improve and expand our Nation's rail system,'' said the President. 
``Jolene Molitoris is a seasoned executive with direct experience in 
doing the kinds of things we need to be doing.''
