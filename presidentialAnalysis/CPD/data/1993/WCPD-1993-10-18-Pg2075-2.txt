Nomination for Deputy United States Trade Representative

 October 14, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate former 
Washington Governor, Booth Gardner to be Deputy United States Trade 
Representative, with the rank of Ambassador. He will serve in USTR's 
Geneva, Switzerland office, representing the U.S. before the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body on trade policies and 
practices among nations.
    ``Booth Gardner was one of the very best Governors with whom I 
served. He has a solid background in business and trade'' said the 
President, ``and knows firsthand the importance of free and fair trade 
to keeping our economy strong and creating jobs for American workers. I 
think he will do an outstanding job in Geneva.''

Press Secretary.
