Letter to Attorney General Janet Reno on Child Pornography

 November 10, 1993

Dear Madam Attorney General:

    A dispute recently has arisen over the scope of the current federal 
child pornography law. This dispute impelled the Senate to adopt a 
``sense of the Senate'' resolution expressing its view that the law 
reaches broadly. I fully agree with the Senate about what the proper 
scope of the child pornography law should be.
    I find all forms of child pornography offensive and harmful, as I 
know you do, and I want the federal government to lead aggressively in 
the attack against the scourge of child pornography. It represents an 
unacceptable exploitation of children and contributes to the degradation 
of our national life and to a societal climate that appears to condone 
child abuse.
    This Administration supports the broadest possible protections 
against child pornography and exploitation. I understand that the 
Justice Department recently filed a brief in which the Department 
concluded that the current child pornography law is not as broad as it 
could be. Accordingly, the Justice Department should promptly prepare 
and submit any necessary legislation to ensure that federal law reaches 
all forms of child pornography, including the kinds of child pornography 
at issue in the Senate resolution.
    Sincerely,
                                                  Bill Clinton
