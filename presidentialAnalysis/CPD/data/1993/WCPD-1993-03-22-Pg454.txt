Statement on the Retirement of Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White

 March 19, 1993

    This morning I received a letter from Justice Byron White informing 
me that he intends to retire at the end of the current Supreme Court 
term.
    He is a living example of the American dream fulfilled. He came from 
humble beginnings, was a star college and professional athlete, a Rhodes 
scholar, a prominent private attorney, and Deputy Attorney General at 
one of the most important times in our history before joining the Court 
in 1962. In his 31 years on the Supreme Court, Justice White served his 
country and our Constitution well. We are all more fortunate that he 
devoted the great portion of his life to public service.
