Statement by the Press Secretary on Kuwait's Lifting of the Boycott of 
Companies Dealing With Israel

 June 9, 1993

    We welcome the announcement by the Government of Kuwait that it has 
lifted the economic boycott of companies that do business with Israel. 
Elimination of this boycott has been a high priority for the President 
since he assumed office. The administration has repeatedly pressed Arab 
Governments and our allies to end this economic discrimination. In this 
regard, during his visit to the Middle East in February, within a month 
of assuming office, Secretary of State Warren Christopher emphasized the 
priority that this administration places on elimination of the boycott 
during his visit to Kuwait and other Arab capitals. We have continued to 
press

the issue since then through a variety of bilateral and multilateral 
contacts.
    Kuwait's action also represents an important step forward in opening 
additional business opportunities for American companies in the Middle 
East. We will continue to urge others in the Middle East to follow 
Kuwait's lead and eliminate their adherence to the boycott. We will also 
continue to work with our allies in Europe and Japan to take further 
steps to eliminate the boycott.
