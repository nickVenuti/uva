Statement on the Death of Matthew Ridgway

 July 27, 1993

    There can be no greater tribute for a patriot than to say he spent 
his life serving his nation. General Matthew Ridgway was such a patriot. 
He fought for our liberty and in opposition to tyranny through two great 
conflicts, World War II and the Korean conflict. Through his efforts, 
General Ridgway became one of our most venerated military leaders. His 
greatest legacy is the freedom his tireless work helped preserve and 
promote.
    Hillary and I wish to extend our condolences to Mrs. Ridgway and the 
rest of his family. We all owe a debt of gratitude to Matthew Ridgway, 
soldier and patriot.
