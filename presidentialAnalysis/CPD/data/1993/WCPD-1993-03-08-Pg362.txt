Bosnia

    Q. Mr. President, can you tell us any more about the Bosnian 
sanctions that you're putting on today?
    The President. No, we'll have more to say.
    Q. Are these going to be unilateral or through the United Nations?
    The President. We'll put it out--I'm not--everything we've done on 
the sanctions so far is, and all of the things I've explored with our 
allies has pretty well been supported by everyone.
    Q. Are the Russians sending arms to Serbia, sir?
    The President. I'm in a photo op. [Laughter]

Note: The exchange began at 11:21 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White
