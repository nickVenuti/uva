Potential Supreme Court Nominee

    Q. Mr. President, excuse the interruption, sir, but could you give 
us some feel for what you'll be looking for in a replacement for Justice 
White?
    The President. I already said that in Washington. I used to teach 
constitutional law, and I think that there are few decisions the 
President makes which are more weighty, more significant, or can have a 
greater impact on more Americans than an appointment to the Supreme 
Court. And I'm going to try to pick a person that has a fine mind, good 
judgment, wide experience in the law and in the problems of real people, 
and someone with a big heart.
