Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan

 January 28, 1993

    Q. Mr. President, what's the principle you're fighting for in 
sticking with your plan to ban gays in the military? What's the 
principle that you believe that makes you want to stick with that?
    The President. I came here to talk about the economy today with Mr. 
Greenspan. If he wants to express his opinion on that subject, I'll be 
glad to hear it. [Laughter] Most people with whom I talk, except you 
folks, never discuss that. We have other things we're trying to deal 
with.
    Q. Sir, there was good news about the economy--[inaudible]
    The President. I think that there's a lot of response to the efforts 
we're making now, but there's also a lot of troubling news about lost 
jobs. And we've got a lot of work to do, a lot of work to do.

Note: The exchange began at 9:37 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these
