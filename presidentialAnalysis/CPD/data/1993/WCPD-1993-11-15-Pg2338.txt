Notice on Chemical and Biological Weapons Proliferation

 November 12, 1993

    On November 16, 1990, consistent with the authority provided the 
President under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701, et seq.), President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12735. 
In that order, the President declared a national emergency with respect 
to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security posed 
by the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. Because the 
proliferation of these weapons continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on November 16, 1990, 
must continue in effect beyond November 16, 1993. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order No. 12735.
    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
November 12, 1993.
