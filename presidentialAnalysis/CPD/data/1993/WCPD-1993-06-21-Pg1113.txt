Exchange With Reporters Following Discussions With King Hussein of 
Jordan

 June 18, 1993

Budget Proposal

    Q. Do you like the budget?
    The President. I think in the end, I like it a lot. It's not done 
yet. We're not even through the Senate yet. We've got a lot of work to 
do.
    Q. Mr. President, what's your reaction to the reprimand accepted by 
General Campbell?
    Q. What do you think about--for Campbell?

[At this point, one group of reporters left the room, and another group 
entered.]

    Q. What did you accomplish today in the meeting, sir?
    The President. Talked a lot about the peace process. I learned about 
the King's position; he learned about the United States position. We 
talked a little about Iraq and the imperative nature of continuing to 
enforce those sanctions and being very tough on them. We talked about 
his efforts to democratize the country and to modernize the economy and 
deal with all the things he's dealt with over the last 40 years and 
especially the last 3. It was a very, very good meeting.

Note: The exchange began at 1:50 p.m. at the Diplomatic Entrance at the 
White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
this exchange.
