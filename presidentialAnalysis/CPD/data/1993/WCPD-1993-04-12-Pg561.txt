Announcement of Nomination for Three Sub-Cabinet Posts

 April 6, 1993

    The President today named three deputies to the Departments of 
Energy, Interior and the Office of Personnel Management. The President 
announced his intention to nominate William H. White as Deputy Secretary 
at the Department of Energy and Lorraine A. Green as Deputy Director of 
the Office of Personnel Management. In addition, the President approved 
Allen P. Stayman as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Territorial and 
International Affairs at the Department of the Interior.
    ``The field experience, technical know-how, and commitment to 
excellence these three individuals have demonstrated in the past will 
serve them well as they join our teams already in place at Energy, OPM, 
and Interior,'' the President said. ``I have full confidence they will 
work hard to reinvent the way Government works.''
