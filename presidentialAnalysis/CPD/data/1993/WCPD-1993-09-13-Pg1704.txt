Statement on Senate Action Confirming Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General

 September 7, 1993

    I am extremely pleased and gratified by the Senate's action today in 
confirming Dr. Joycelyn Elders as the Nation's next Surgeon General. Dr. 
Elders has consistently demonstrated a high level of intellect, courage, 
and wisdom in dealing with the wide range of health and social problems 
facing our country. Her dedication to improving the lives of all 
Americans, especially the children of America, won her the strong 
backing of a bipartisan majority of the Senate. I look forward to 
working with her in confronting the pressing issues facing the public 
health of our Nation.
    I am especially grateful to Senator Kennedy for his steady 
leadership during the Labor and Human Resources Committee's 
consideration of Dr. Elders' nomination. Senator Kennedy's dedication to 
this nominee was extraordinary.
