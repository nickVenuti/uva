Caucus

Spending Cuts

    Q. Mr. President, do you agree with the extra $50 billion in cuts 
that the House and Senate leaders want?
    The President. I agree that we will have a budget resolution which 
will be roughly conforming to the reestimates of the CBO in general 
terms. And that will still contain the investment strategy that I wanted 
to do.

House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this
