Statement by the Press Secretary on the President's Meeting With NATO 
Secretary General Manfred Woerner

 October 6, 1993

    The President met today with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner 
in the Oval Office. The President and Secretary Woerner discussed 
developments in Bosnia and exchanged ideas about preparations for the 
January 1994 NATO summit. They expressed their common commitment to 
taking advantage of this historic opportunity to chart NATO's course in 
the post-cold-war Europe.
    The President and the Secretary General agreed that the NATO summit 
should reaffirm the strength of the transatlantic security partnership 
and advance the process of adapting NATO to Europe's new security 
environment. They discussed how to deepen NATO's engagement in Europe's 
east and further the development of a ``European pillar'' within the 
alliance.
