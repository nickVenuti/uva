To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with section 201(3) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves 
Production Act of 1976 (10 U.S.C. 7422(c)(2)), I am informing you of my 
decision to extend the period of maximum efficient rate production of 
the naval petroleum reserves for 3 years from April 5, 1994, the 
expiration date of the currently authorized production period.
    The report investigating the necessity of continued production of 
the reserves as required by section 201(3)(c)(2)(B) of the Naval 
Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 is attached. Based on the 
report's findings, I hereby certify that continued production from the 
naval petroleum reserves is in the national interest.
