Nominations for Posts at the Department of the Interior

 May 18, 1993

    The President announced today his intention to nominate Molly H. 
Beattie, the director of a Vermont public policy center and former State 
natural resources official, to be Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. In addition, the President announced that his longtime 
environmental aide Kenneth Smith has been appointed the Fish and 
Wildlife Service's Deputy Director.

    ``Secretary Babbitt and I have placed a high priority on finding new 
ways to protect biological diversity without endangering economic 
growth,'' said the President. ``The Fish and Wildlife Service will play 
a big role in that process. I have full confidence in the ability of 
Molly Beattie and Ken Smith to do the hard work and the fresh thinking 
that needs to be done.''

the Press Secretary.
