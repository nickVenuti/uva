Statement on Senate Action on the National and Community Service Trust 
Act of 1993

 September 8, 1993

    I want to thank and congratulate Members of the United States Senate 
today for passing a landmark piece of legislation, the National and 
Community Service Trust Act of 1993.
    Many times I have talked about how national service will bring 
together Americans from a wide variety of backgrounds, expand their 
educational opportunity, and empower a new generation to take on our 
Nation's most pressing domestic needs. Thousands will spend a year or 
two serving their country and their communities, working as teachers, as 
health care workers, or on environmental projects, while helping to pay 
for school.
    In the best sense of reinventing Government, the new Corporation for 
National and Community Service will emphasize decentralization in favor 
of empowering local initiatives that devise local solutions to local 
problems. It will be bold and it will be entrepreneurial in its quest 
for excellent programs and quality participants. Its business plan will 
be an unwavering mandate to get things done in our communities and our 
country.
    Today's Senate action is yet another opportunity for change for the 
American people. National service will be the American way to change 
America.
