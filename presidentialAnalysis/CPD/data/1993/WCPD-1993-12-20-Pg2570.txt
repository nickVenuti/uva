Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Kyrgyzstan

 December 9, 1993

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Kyrgyzstan to the 
list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. 
market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
    I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 
and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, and 
particularly Kyrgyzstan's level of development and initiation of 
economic reforms, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP 
benefits to Kyrgyzstan.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on
