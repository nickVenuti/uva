Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders

 July 19, 1993

    Q. Mr. President, have you given up on a utility tax, and how much 
of an increase would you take on a gas tax? And besides that----
    The President. Well, I'm just sitting here meeting with the 
chairmen, and I'm going to also, you know, keep working through this 
with the conferees. And we're going to see what we can do. But we're 
just beginning our conversations, so I can't answer those questions.
    Q. Sir, what qualifications will the new FBI Director have?
    The President. Good ones.

Note: The exchange began at 5:06 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this
