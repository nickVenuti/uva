    ``I have long admired and sought to support the ongoing work of the 
American Red Cross to bring aid to those in need both around the world 
and here in our own communities,'' said the President. ``As I recently 
saw firsthand during the Midwest flooding this summer, their workers and 
volunteers are true lifesavers. I am appointing this senior group of 
officials to serve on their board because I want to be sure that my 
administration does everything that we can to support the Red Cross' 
important work.''
