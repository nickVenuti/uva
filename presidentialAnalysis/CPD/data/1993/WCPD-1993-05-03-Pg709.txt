Statement by the Press Secretary on the President's Meeting With the 
Dalai Lama

 April 28, 1993

    The President and the Vice President met yesterday with His Holiness 
the Dalai Lama and discussed issues relating to Tibet.
    ``The Dalai Lama is internationally revered for his spiritual and 
moral leadership,'' the President said. ``As a Nobel Peace Price winner 
and committed advocate of nonviolent change and resolution of disputes, 
I deeply appreciated hearing the Dalai Lama's views on the situation in 
China, including Tibet. The administration continues to urge Beijing and 
the Dalai Lama to revive a dialog between them and presses China to 
address human rights abuses in Tibet.''
