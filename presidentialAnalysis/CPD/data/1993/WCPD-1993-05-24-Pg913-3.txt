Statement on the Death of John Wilson

 May 19, 1993

    As residents of the District of Columbia, Hillary and I mourn the 
sudden and tragic loss of DC City Council Chairman John Wilson. John was 
a tremendous individual who devoted his life's work to the empowerment 
and benefit of the District's citizens.

    We know the love that John had for the District of Columbia will be 
remembered and cherished by all the city's residents as his service and 
achievements are profoundly appreciated.

    Hillary and I will keep his wife, Bonnie, in our prayers.
