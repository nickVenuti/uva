Nomination of Ambassador to Mexico

 June 2, 1993

    The President declared his intention today to nominate Jim Jones, 
the CEO of the American Stock Exchange and former House Budget Committee 
chairman, to the position of Ambassador to Mexico.

    ``A great deal of our economic future,'' said the President, ``is 
bound up in our relationships in this hemisphere, particularly our 
relationship with Mexico. That is why I have chosen an Ambassador who is 
seasoned by years of economic leadership in both the private and public 
sectors. Jim Jones brings a unique perspective and uncommon talents to 
the continuing dialog with our Mexican neighbors.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
