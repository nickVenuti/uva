Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Economic Advisers

 February 3, 1993

    Q. Mr. President, while we have you, why do Social Security 
recipients in the middle class appear to be getting a little bit more 
nervous as your economic plan unfolds? Should they be?
    The President. Well, the way you folks were leaking the story 
today--[laughter].
    The people of this country ought to know that I'm going to do my 
best to be fair to the people that I ran to represent and to get the job 
machine of this country moving again and bring the deficit down. And I 
think the people will believe that I've been fair and comprehensive when 
the plan comes out.
    But you know, it's very difficult for us to make decisions in an 
environment where we have no control over who says what, about what 
really comes out, and half the stuff that comes out is not even 
accurate. So all I can tell you is I'm not going to comment on the 
specifics until I settle on the plan, and then I'll come forward with 
it. But it will be consistent with what I said today to the employees 
over at the OMB.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 2:25 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House.
