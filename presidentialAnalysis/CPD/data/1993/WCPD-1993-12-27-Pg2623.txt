Statement on Majority Leader Richard Gephardt's Support for GATT 
Legislation

 December 21, 1993

    I welcome Majority Leader Richard Gephardt's support for the 
implementation of the Uruguay round agreement. His statement reflects 
the fact that we have a strong agreement that promises important 
benefits for U.S. industry, services, and agriculture. The Majority 
Leader's support will help make it possible to implement the agreement 
expeditiously, with a strong base of congressional support.
    The overriding commitment of this administration in trade policy has 
been to open markets and expand trade--multilaterally where possible, 
and bilaterally where necessary--and to enforce trade laws against 
unfair trade practices by other trading nations. The successful Uruguay 
round result strengthens our hand in doing so, and I look forward to 
working with the Majority Leader and others in Congress on the 
implementing legislation.
