    Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance 
Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that 
it is important to the national interest that up to $6,300,000 of the

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
    You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees 
of the Congress of this determination and the obligation of funds under 
this authority, and to publish this determination in the Federal 
Register.
                                            William J. Clinton
