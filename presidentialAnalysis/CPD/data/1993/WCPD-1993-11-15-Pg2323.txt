Nomination for United States District Court Judge

 November 10, 1993

    The President today nominated Judge Daniel Hurley to serve as a U.S. 
District Court judge for the Southern District of Florida.

    ``Daniel Hurley has distinguished himself in close to 20 years on 
the bench as a judge of outstanding capability,'' said the President. 
``I expect him to meet that same high standard as a Federal District 
Court judge.''
