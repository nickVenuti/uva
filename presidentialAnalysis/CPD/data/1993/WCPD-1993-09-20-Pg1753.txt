the Secretary of the Treasury

Subject: Extension of the Exercise of Certain Authorities Under the 
Trading With the Enemy Act

    Under section 101(b) of Public Law 95-223 (91 Stat. 1625; 50 U.S.C. 
App. 5(b) note), and a previous determination made by my predecessor on 
August 28, 1992 (57 FR 43125), the exercise of certain authorities under 
the Trading With the Enemy Act is scheduled to terminate on September 
14, 1993.
    I hereby determine that the extension for one year of the exercise 
of those authorities with respect to the applicable countries is in the 
national interest of the United States.
    Therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 101(b) 
of Public Law 95-223, I extend for one year, until September 14, 1994, 
the exercise of those authorities with respect to countries affected by:
    (1) the Foreign Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR Part 500;
    (2) the Transaction Control Regulations, 31 CFR Part 505;
    (3) the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR Part 515; and
    (4) the Foreign Funds Control Regulations, 31 CFR Part 520.
    The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to publish this 
determination in the Federal Register.
