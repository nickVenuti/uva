Statement Endorsing Michael Woo To Be Mayor of Los Angeles

 May 15, 1993

    On June 8, Los Angeles voters will select the first new mayor in two 
decades, a mayor who must reinvigorate the economy and ensure the safety 
of all communities. I endorse Michael Woo because I believe he is the 
best person to meet these challenges.
    As a councilman, Mike Woo has put people first, consistently 
fighting for the middle class against the special interests, appealing 
to our hopes not our fears. He created innovative programs to finance 
small business, reformed the city's ethics laws, and developed a model 
community service program. He has fought to get criminals and their guns 
off the streets.
    Early last year, Mike Woo stood with me to support an agenda of 
change to help working families, rebuild our cities, and bring people 
together. Mike Woo has dedicated his life to creating jobs in southern 
California

and making government work for all people. The people of Los Angeles can 
trust Mike Woo to work long and hard to get the job done for them.
    As mayor, Mike Woo will be my partner to reinvigorate the southern 
California economy, put more police on the streets, and inspire the many 
different communities that comprise Los Angeles to pull together again. 
I look forward to working with him for change.
