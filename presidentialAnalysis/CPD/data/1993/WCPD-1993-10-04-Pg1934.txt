Memorandum on Negotiated Rulemaking

 September 30, 1993

Memorandum for Executive Departments and Selected Agencies, 
Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs

Subject: Negotiated Rulemaking

    Today, I issued the Executive order on Regulatory Planning and 
Review, which sets forth the Administration's regulatory philosophy and 
establishes the procedures to be followed by agencies in promulgating 
regulations. This order also enhances public disclosure requirements and 
public involvement in the regulatory review process. In Section 6(a) of 
the order, I direct each agency to explore and, where appropriate, use 
consensual mechanisms for developing regulations, including negotiated 
rulemaking. Consistent with that directive and the recommendation of the 
National Performance Review on this issue, I further direct each agency, 
within 90 days of this order, to (i) identify to OIRA at least one 
rulemaking which the agency will, within the upcoming year, develop 
through the use of negotiated rulemaking or (ii) explain to OIRA why the 
use of negotiated rulemaking will not be feasible in the upcoming year.
    I further direct the Administrator of OIRA to publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.
