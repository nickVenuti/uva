Memorandum for the Acting Director

Office of Management and Budget

    The Council on Competitiveness, established March 31, 1989, 
terminated on January 20, 1993.
    Pending completion of a review, existing Executive orders on 
regulatory management will continue to apply. You are directed to 
request the agencies described in section 1(d) of Executive Order 12291 
to assure that in publishing regulations, and subject to such exceptions 
as the Director or the Acting Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget determines to be appropriate, all regulations must first be 
approved by an agency head or the designee of an agency head who, in 
either case, is a person appointed by me and confirmed by the Senate.
                                            William J. Clinton
