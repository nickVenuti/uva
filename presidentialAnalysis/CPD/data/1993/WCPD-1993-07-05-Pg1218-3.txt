Nomination for an Assistant Secretary of Labor

 July 1, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to nominate Joseph Dear, 
formerly director of the State of Washington's Department of Labor and 
Industries, to be the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational 
Safety and Health. In that role, he will serve as the Administrator of 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
    ``With his experience running a major State agency regulating 
workplace safety and related matters, Joseph Dear is an outstanding 
choice for this important position,'' said the President. ``During his 
tenure in Washington, he turned a deficit into a $350 million surplus in 
the workers' compensation budget. He established a health care cost 
containment and quality assurance program and overhauled the workers' 
compensation system to save the taxpayers money while increasing 
benefits to workers. That is the kind of leadership I want to have at 
OSHA.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
