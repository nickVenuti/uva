Appointment of United States Representative to the United Nations Human 
Rights Commission

 October 22, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to appoint former 
Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro as the U.S. Representative to the United 
Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), with the rank of Ambassador.
    ``In addition to earning her place in our own country's political 
history, Geraldine Ferraro has been a highly effective voice for the 
human rights of women around the world,'' said the President. ``As 
alternate head of the U.S. delegation to this year's session of the 
UNHRC, she spoke eloquently on behalf of women in the former Yugoslavia 
and brought all of the parties involved to a consensus position. I look 
forward to her continuing her strong and much-needed advocacy in this 
new position.''

Note: A biography of the appointee was made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
