Statement on an Agreement on Pacific Northwest Timber Sales

 August 3, 1993

    We are committed to working to enhance the long-term economic and 
environmental health of the region. That commitment means a responsible 
forest management plan and a responsible but determined effort to get 
timber moving back into the mills. We have offered an innovative, 
comprehensive, and balanced plan to solve a difficult set of problems. 
Now we are taking steps to implement that plan and get timber to the 
mills.

Note: This statement was part of a White House press release announcing 
the agreement.
