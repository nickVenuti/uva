Surgeon General Nominee

    Q. Mr. President, are you confident that Dr. Elders has the answers 
to the questions she'll be asked tomorrow?
    The President. I think she'll do very well.

    Let me also say while Chairman Shushkevich is here that I am very 
honored to have him here in the White House. And I want to thank him 
publicly for the support his country has given to the nonproliferation 
regime and to START I. We're going to have a good partnership. I look 
forward to its development. And I very much appreciate the fact that he 
has come here off of a successful commitment by his nation to be 
nonnuclear. And it means a lot to the United States and to the world.

Midwest Disaster Assistance

    Q. Are you concerned about getting the flood money from the House, 
sir?
    The President. No, not from what I heard about that. I think it's 
okay.

Note: The exchange began at 5:40 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White
