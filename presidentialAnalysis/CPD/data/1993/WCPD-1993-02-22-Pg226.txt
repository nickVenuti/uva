Nomination of Thomas Glynn To Be Deputy Secretary of Labor

 February 19, 1993


    The President announced today his intention to nominate Thomas Glynn 
of Belmont, Massachusetts for the post of Deputy Secretary of Labor. 
Glynn is currently Brown University's senior vice president for finance 
and administration.
    ``One of the most important things we need to do in this 
administration is learn how to manage the Government better,'' said 
President Clinton. ``I've pledged to save $9 billion by controlling 
administrative costs. Thomas Glynn has the kind of experience managing 
large institutions, both public and private, that is needed to make that 
happen.''
    Glynn has served at Brown since April 1991. Prior to that he was the 
general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, 
general manager of the World Trade Center Boston, deputy commissioner of 
the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare, and assistant dean of 
the Florence Heller Graduate School at Brandeis University. He served in 
a variety of positions in the Carter administration. Glynn's public 
service began with 2 years as a VISTA volunteer in South Boston. Glynn 
is a resident of Belmont, MA.
