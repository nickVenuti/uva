Exchange With Reporters in Frederick, Maryland

The Economic Plan

    Q. Mr. President, speaking of construction, should Lani Guinier 
withdraw?
    The President. I'll have more to say about that later. But this is 
the most important thing I'm working on. This is the illustration of why 
the economic program is important. Housing sales at a 7-month high last 
month, creating jobs for people like this because of low mortgage rates. 
If we can keep the interest rates down by passing the economic program, 
getting the deficit down, you're going to see a lot more jobs, a lot 
more homes, a lot of money putting into this economy. That's the real 
important thing that this administration was elected to do and that's 
what I'm working on.

Note: The exchange began at 11:11 a.m. while the President was touring a 
house under construction in Fredericktown Village.
