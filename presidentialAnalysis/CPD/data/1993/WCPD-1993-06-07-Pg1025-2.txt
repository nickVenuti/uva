Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Bulgaria

 June 3, 1993

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit a report concerning emigration laws and policies 
of the Republic of Bulgaria as required by subsections 402(b) and 409(b) 
of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (``the Act'') (19 
U.S.C. 2432(b) and 2439(b)). I have determined that Bulgaria is in full 
compliance with the criteria in subsections 402(a) and 409(a) of the 
Act. As required by Title IV, I will provide the Congress with periodic 
reports regarding Bulgaria's compliance with these emigration standards.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
