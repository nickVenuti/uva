Statement on the Withdrawal of Shirley Chisholm's Nomination To Be 
Ambassador to Jamaica

 October 13, 1993

    I deeply regret that illness has forced Shirley Chisholm to ask that 
her nomination to be our country's Ambassador to Jamaica be withdrawn. 
As I said when I first announced my decision to nominate her, Shirley 
Chisholm is a true pioneer of American politics. Even before she ran for 
elective office, she had made her mark through her work teaching the 
children of New York and through the force of her remarkable 
personality. As the U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica, she would have been a 
powerful voice for cooperation and justice.
    Hillary and I both wish Shirley Chisholm all the best at this 
difficult time. She is in our thoughts and in our prayers.

Note: The President's statement was included in a White House statement 
announcing the withdrawal of Shirley Chisholm's nomination to be 
Ambassador to Jamaica.
