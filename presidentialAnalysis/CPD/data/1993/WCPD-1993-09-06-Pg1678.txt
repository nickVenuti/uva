Nomination for Director of the Indian Health Service

 August 31, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Dr. Michael 
Trujillo, a physician who has spent his career working to better health 
care delivery to Native Americans across the country, as Director of the 
Indian Health Service within the Department of Health and Human 
Services.
    ``Many Americans are without adequate health care, but access to 
care for our country's Native Americans has been particularly poor,'' 
the President said. ``Dr. Trujillo has a well-earned reputation for 
working to change that situation, and I am confident he will work hard 
to improve the delivery of health care to Native Americans in our cities 
and reservations.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
