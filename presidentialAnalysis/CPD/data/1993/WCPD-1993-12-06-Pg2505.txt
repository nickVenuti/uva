Statement on the Technology Reinvestment Project

 December 3, 1993

    To win in the new global economy and safeguard our national 
security, America must invest in new technologies with both commercial 
and military applications. This program will help give us the edge that 
will keep America strong and create new jobs at the same time.
    This program is designed to keep American manufacturing workers, 
from the engineers to the machine operators, at the top of their fields. 
Efficient, high-quality production using a skilled, well-equipped work 
force will put American products on shelves throughout the world and put 
Americans to work in high-paying jobs here at home.

Note: This statement was part of a White House announcement on naming 
the third group of awards in the technology reinvestment project.
