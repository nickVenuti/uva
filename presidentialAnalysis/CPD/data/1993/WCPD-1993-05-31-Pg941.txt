Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President Richard von 
Weizsacker of Germany

 May 24, 1993

Bosnia

    Q. Mr. President, have you been surprised or disappointed by the 
reaction in Bosnia and Serbia----
    The President. You mean, the opposition to it?
    Q. The opposition and the initial support from Mr. Karadzic.
    The President. No, it's about like I expected it to be.
    Q. ----U.N. observers into Serbian territory, how does that 
complicate things?
    The President. I don't want to say any more about it now. I want to 
talk to the President about it. We'll try to just absorb what has been 
said and make the appropriate decision. But I'm not particularly 
surprised by the various responses----

    Q. Mr. President, do you hope this week goes better than last week?

    The President. We had a good week last week. The Ways and Means 
Committee voted the bill out--signed the motor voter bill.

Note: The exchange began at 4:05 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this
