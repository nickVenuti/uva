Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders

 July 27, 1993

Economic Program

    Q. Mr. President, are these your ``delay in gridlock'' friends?
    The President. These are my friends. This group had always supported 
an aggressive approach to deficit reduction, the balanced approach.

Middle East Peace Talks

    Q. Are you sure?
    Why is Secretary Christopher coming back?
    The President. Because I want to talk with him about the Middle East 
before he goes there.
    Q. Do you think the peace process is in jeopardy, sir?
    The President. Well, I hope not. I certainly have no reason to 
believe that it is, but obviously I'm concerned about it. I think the 
Syrians have shown commendable restraint so far. And I don't think we 
should let Hezbollah and all these groups that don't want anything good 
to happen in the Middle East derail the peace process by what they do. I 
don't think we should, any of us, should allow that. I mean, I really 
want something to happen there. So I'm very hopeful. But I thought that 
in view of the events there, that he ought to come home, and we ought to 
have a conversation about it before he goes to the Middle East.

Note: The exchange began at 10:20 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of
