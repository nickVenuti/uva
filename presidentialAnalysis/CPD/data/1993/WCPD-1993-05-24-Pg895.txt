    The President announced his intention to nominate John Donahue to be

    ``John Donahue is a leading expert on the relationship between 
business and Government,'' said the President. ``He and Secretary Reich 
have worked together productively in the past, and I am confident that 
they will work together now to create policies aimed at giving our 
country the most productive, best trained work force in the world.''
