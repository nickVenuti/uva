Statement on Signing the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993

 December 17, 1993

    Today I have signed into law S. 422, the ``Government Securities Act 
Amendments of 1993.'' S. 422 permanently reauthorizes the Treasury 
Department's rulemaking authority under the Government Securities Act 
and extends important investor protections to the Government securities 
market. It also provides important new surveillance tools to the 
Department of the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
This legislation will help maintain the confidence of investors in the 
integrity of the Government securities market. It will thus ensure that 
the Treasury has access to an efficient and liquid market, which is 
vital to selling the Government's debt at the lowest possible cost.
    I am pleased that the legislative process achieved compromises 
acceptable to the many interested participants. I thank all involved for 
their hard work culminating in the enactment of this comprehensive and 
needed legislation. As a result of their efforts, the Federal Government 
now has the tools necessary to ensure the continuing integrity, 
efficiency, and liquidity of the Government securities market.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
December 17, 1993.

Note: S. 422, approved December 17, was assigned Public Law No. 103-202.
