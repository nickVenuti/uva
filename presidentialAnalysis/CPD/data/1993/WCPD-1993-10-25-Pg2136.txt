Message to the Congress Transmitting the Poland-United States Fishery 
Agreement

 October 21, 1993

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-265; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit 
herewith an Agreement between the Government of the United States of 
America and the Government of the Republic of Poland Extending the 
Agreement of August 1, 1985, Concerning Fisheries off the Coasts of the 
United States. The agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes 
at Washington June 8 and July 29, 1993, extends the 1985 agreement for 
an additional 2 years, from December 31, 1993, to December 31, 1995. The 
exchange of notes together with the 1985 agreement constitute a 
governing international fishery agreement within the requirements of 
section 201(c) of the Act.
    I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this 
agreement at an early date.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
October 21, 1993.
