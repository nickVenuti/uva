Statement on Senate Action on National Service Legislation

 August 3, 1993

    I am extremely pleased by action taken today by the Senate in 
passing the National and Community Service Trust Act. I am also 
gratified that Republicans and Democrats were able to work together to 
turn this landmark legislation into reality.
    National service will take on our Nation's most pressing unmet needs 
while empowering a new generation to serve as leaders of change. 
National service is about enhanced educational opportunity and 
rebuilding the American community. Most importantly, national service is 
about getting things done.
    A number of Senators played crucial roles in helping pass this bill. 
In particular, I would like to thank Senator Kennedy for the leadership 
and dedication he has shown throughout this process. Thanks to the 
efforts of the Senate today and the House last week, young people will 
soon be serving their country in their communities here at home.
    I've always said national service is the American way to change 
America. I commend the United States Congress for taking action that 
will prove that true.
