Nomination for a Member of the National Labor Relations Board

 June 28, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate law 
professor and arbitrator William Gould to the National Labor Relations 
Board.
    ``William Gould has a tremendous amount of both practical and 
scholarly experience in labor law,'' said the President, ``and stands 
for the principles I want the NLRB to uphold: the rights of all workers 
to participate in labor organizations and the need for labor and 
management to work together to increase our Nation's competitiveness in 
a global marketplace. I think that he will be an excellent addition to 
the Labor Relations Board.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
