Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Strengthening America's 
Shipyards

 October 1, 1993

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the requirements of section 1031 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484), I 
transmit herewith a report entitled ``Strengthening America's Shipyards: 
A Plan for Competing in the International Market.''
    The U.S. shipbuilding industry is unsurpassed in building the finest 
and most complex naval vessels in the world. Now that the Cold War has 
ended, these shipyards, like many other defense firms, face a new 
challenge--translating their skills from the military to the commercial 
market. Individual shipyards already have begun to meet this challenge. 
The enclosed report describes steps that the Government is taking and 
will take to assist their efforts. I look forward to working with the 
Congress and the industry to ensure a successful transition to a 
competitive industry in a truly competitive marketplace.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
October 1, 1993.
