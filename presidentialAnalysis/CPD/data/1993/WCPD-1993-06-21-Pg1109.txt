Statement on Senate Action on Campaign Finance Reform Legislation

 June 17, 1993

    Today's vote is a victory for the American people and a setback for 
the special interests. Government will only serve the middle class if 
Washington works for the national interest and not narrow interests. By 
breaking the filibuster and overwhelmingly passing campaign finance 
reform legislation, the Senate has answered the call for change. This 
legislation's sponsors and supporters deserve our gratitude.
    This bill will end the days when candidates could crush their 
opponents with unanswered spending by setting voluntary spending limits 
for candidates. It severely limits PAC's and bans contributions from 
lobbyists to the lawmakers they contact. It ends the abuses of the 
``soft money'' system. I continue to believe that we should do more to 
open up the airwaves to candidates. But all in all, this legislation is 
comprehensive, real reform.
    The process of political reform should now move forward quickly. I 
urge the House of Representatives to enact the strongest possible 
legislation. Previous Presidents have blocked and even vetoed political 
reform. I look forward to signing it.
