    The President appointed five regional representatives for the

    Brenda Dann-Messier, Region I, Boston (serves Connecticut, Maine, 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont);

    W. Wilson Goode, Region III, Philadelphia (serves Delaware, District

    ``As former Governors who spent years trying to improve our States' 
education systems, Secretary Riley and I are committed to an Education 
Department that is responsive to the needs of States and communities,'' 
the President said in making the announcement. ``The people who will 
serve as the Department's regional representatives share that commitment 
and will work hard to fulfill it. I am very proud of these choices.''
