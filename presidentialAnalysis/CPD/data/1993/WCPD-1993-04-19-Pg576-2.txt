Nomination of Commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
and Designation of Chairman

 April 12, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to nominate four experts 
on energy regulation, Bill Massey, Donald Santa, James Hoecker, and 
Vicky Bailey, to be Commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission. He also announced his intention to designate Elizabeth Anne 
``Betsy'' Moler as the Commission's Chair, a position she has held on an 
interim basis since February.
    ``I have called for a sensible, comprehensive energy policy that 
serves our future energy needs, protects our precious environment, and 
helps to build a growing economy,'' said the President. ``This 
experienced and talented group of Commissioners will help to meet those 
goals.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
