    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of the 
International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288), and in light 
of the Act of Congress authorizing the participation of the United 
States in the International Development Law Institute, section 805 of 
the Freedom Support Act of 1992, Public Law 102-511, I hereby designate 
the International Development Law Institute as a public international 
organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and 
immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act. 
This designation is not intended to abridge in any respect the 
privileges, exemptions, or immunities that such organization may have 
acquired or may acquire by international agreements or by congressional 
action.
