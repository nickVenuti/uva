Space Administration

 December 23, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Arnold G. 
Holz, assistant comptroller and director of general accounting for the 
State of Maryland, to be Chief Financial Officer at the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
    ``The depth of experience that Arnold Holz has acquired in 34 years 
of complex accounting, auditing, and financial reporting activities is a 
welcomed addition to the Nation's space exploration program as it enters 
a new era of international cooperation to build a space station and 
prepares for sustained human exploration of the solar system,'' the 
President said.

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
