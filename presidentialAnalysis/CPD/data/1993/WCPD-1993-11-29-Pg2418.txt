 November 19, 1993

    The President nominated eleven individuals to be U.S. district court 
judges. They are:
    Fred Biery, Western District of Texas; W. Royal Furgeson, Western 
District of Texas; Orlando Garcia, Western District of Texas; John 
Hannah, Eastern District of Texas; Janis Graham Jack, Southern District 
of Texas; Franklin D. Burgess, Western District of Washington; Michael 
J. Davis, District of Minnesota; Ancer Haggerty, District of Oregon; 
Michael A. Ponsor, District of Massachusetts; Marjorie O. Rendell, 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania; and Lesley Brooks Wells, Northern 
District of Ohio.
    ``As the Senate completes its work for this session, I am very 
pleased at the progress we have made in filling judicial vacancies,'' 
said the President. ``We have nominated more Federal judges by 
Thanksgiving than any of my recent predecessors and have appointed 
judges who are marked by both their excellence and commitment to public 
service. I intend to continue on this course when the Congress returns 
next year.''
