Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Mauritania

 June 25, 1993

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I am writing concerning the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). 
The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market for products 
that are imported from developing countries. It is authorized by title V 
of the Trade Act of 1974.
    Pursuant to title V, I have determined that Mauritania no longer 
meets the eligibility requirements set forth in the GSP law. In 
particular, I have determined that it has not taken and is not taking 
steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights. Accordingly, I 
intend to suspend Mauritania indefinitely as a designated beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the GSP.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(2) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
An original was not available for verification of the content of this
