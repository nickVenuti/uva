Nomination of Pamela Harriman To Be United States Ambassador to France

 March 23, 1993

    President Clinton announced today his intention to nominate Pamela 
Harriman to be Ambassador to France.
    ``Anyone who has been involved with the Democratic Party for any 
length of time is certainly familiar with Mrs. Harriman's talent for 
diplomacy,'' said the President. ``Her many years of dedicated service 
to the United States and her unceasing devotion to the cause of world 
peace are only two of the many qualifications that she will bring with 
her to Paris.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
