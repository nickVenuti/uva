Statement on the Massachusetts Building Trade Council Endorsement of 
NAFTA

 November 12, 1993

    Today, we saw a profile in courage. Leo Purcell, president of the 
Massachusetts Building Trade Council, endorsed NAFTA in a letter to 
fellow union workers.
    In addition to saying, as I have, that this is a choice between 
change and status quo, Purcell, wrote, ``No longer can nations afford to 
build invisible walls at their borders because there are no longer 
national borders to free trade.''
    I applaud Mr. Purcell for his leadership, courage, and vision and 
for his strong confidence in the American worker.

Note: A copy of the letter that was sent to the President from Leo 
Purcell was made available by the Office of the Press Secretary. This 
item was not received in time for publication in the appropriate issue.
