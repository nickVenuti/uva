Remarks at a White House Dinner Honoring Arts and Humanities Award 
Recipients

 October 7, 1993

    Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you all to the White House and 
thank you for coming and for each of your contributions to the rich 
cultural life of our great Nation. I want to say a special word of 
appreciation again to the honorees from this afternoon. I had a 
wonderful time with all of you this afternoon. So many of you have 
forgiven my ad-lib jokes, I might ask you back again next week. 
[Laughter] I may have you tell my daughter I'm funny after all.
    I want you to know, that to all of you who have been honored and to 
all of the distinguished artists who are here as our guests tonight who 
didn't join us this afternoon, we are all very much in your debt. You 
have, each in your own way, enriched our lives and helped us to learn 
more and feel more deeply and to become more of the people God meant for 
us to be. We applaud your work. We honor your contributions, and I ask 
you now that all of us together raise our glasses in toast to the 
artists, the writers, the humanitarians who have made America the place 
it is today.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 8:30 p.m. in the State Dining 
Room at the White House.
