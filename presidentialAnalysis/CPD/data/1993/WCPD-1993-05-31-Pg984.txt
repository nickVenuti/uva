Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Most-Favored-
Nation Trade Status for China

 May 28, 1993

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Pursuant to subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended, 19 U.S.C. 2432(d)(1) (``the Act''), I hereby submit the 
attached report concerning the continuation of a waiver of application 
of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act to the People's 
Republic of China. The report explains my reasons for having determined 
that continuation of the waiver currently in effect for the People's 
Republic of China will substantially promote the objectives of section 
402. In addition, I am also transmitting herewith for your further 
information a copy of an Executive Order which enumerates the specific 
conditions which I have established with respect to a further extension 
of the waiver next year for the period beginning July 3, 1994.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
