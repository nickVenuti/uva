 August 30, 1993

Presidential Determination No. 93-36

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

Subject: Determination and Waiver of Romania's Ineligibility Under 
Section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to Receive Certain U.S. 
Nuclear Exports

    Pursuant to section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended 
by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-242), I hereby 
determine that Romania has materially violated the Romania-IAEA 
safeguards agreement and the U.S.-IAEA-Romania supply agreement. I 
hereby further determine that cessation of exports as provided for by 
section 129 of the Act would be seriously prejudicial to the achievement 
of United States nonproliferation objectives or otherwise jeopardize the 
common defense and security.
    You are directed to report this Determination to the Congress and to 
provide copies of the Justification explaining the basis for this 
Determination. You are further directed to publish this Determination in 
the Federal Register.
                                            William J. Clinton
