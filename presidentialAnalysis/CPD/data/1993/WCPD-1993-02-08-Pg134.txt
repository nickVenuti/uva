Letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency Acting Director William C. 
Tidball on Disaster Assistance for California

 February 3, 1993

Dear Mr. Tidball:

    I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of 
California, resulting from severe winter storms, mud and rock slides, 
and flooding on January 5-22, 1993, is of sufficient severity and 
magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration under the Robert T. 
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford 
Act''). I, therefore, declare that such a major disaster exists in the 
State of California.

    In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to 
allocate from funds available for these purposes, such amounts as you 
find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative 
expenses.

    You are authorized to provide Individual Assistance and Public 
Assistance in the designated areas. Consistent with the requirement that 
Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the 
Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the 
total eligible costs.
    Sincerely,
                                                  Bill Clinton
