Statement on Signing Legislation Designating the Thurgood Marshall 
Federal Judiciary Building

 February 8, 1993

    Today, I am signing into law, S. 202, which designates the newly-
completed Federal Judiciary Building in Washington, D.C. as the 
``Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building.''
    It is fitting that a building which houses the work of more than 
2000 judicial employees be named after a man who dedicated more than six 
decades of his life to public service in the judicial arena. Leading the 
legal arm of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People, Thurgood Marshall worked tirelessly for more than a quarter 
century to dismantle racial segregation in all manner of human endeavor. 
His twenty-nine victories before the U.S. Supreme Court serve as a 
reminder to the American people of our individual potential to have a 
dramatic impact in our service to others.
    Marshall brought the same fervent commitment to social equality to 
his work as an appeals court judge, the Solicitor General of the United 
States and Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. His 
insistent vision for America is a legacy which I hope we will cherish 
and strive to fulfill.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
February 8, 1993.

Note: S. 202, approved February 8, was assigned Public Law No. 103-4.
