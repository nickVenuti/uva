Message to the Congress on Adjustment of the National Deficit

 January 21, 1993

To the Congress of the United States:

    Pursuant to section 254(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended (``Act'') (2 U.S.C. 904(c)), 
notification is hereby provided of my decision that the adjustment of 
the maximum deficit amount, as allowed under section 253(g)(1)(B) of the 
Act (2 U.S.C. 903(g)(1)(B)), shall be made.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
January 21, 1993.

Note: The White House released the following statement by the Director 
of Communications George Stephanopoulos on adjustment of the national 
deficit:

  As provided by the law, the President has today notified the 
congressional leadership of technical adjustments to be made in 
calculating the national deficit.

  This procedure, which occurred automatically under the previous 
administration for 3 fiscal years, prevents across-the-board budget 
reductions in accounts such as national defense that could equal 11 
percent in the beginning of the next fiscal year.

  A failure to make this adjustment would also undermine the credibility 
of economic and budget estimates.

  President Clinton will soon put before the Congress a real economic 
program aimed at reducing the deficit and providing long-term economic 
growth.
