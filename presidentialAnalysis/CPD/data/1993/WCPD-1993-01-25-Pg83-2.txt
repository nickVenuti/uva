Remarks to Groups from the Inaugural Parade

 January 21, 1993

    The President. Thank you. One of the first lessons that I was told 
to learn about becoming President is that the President could not fix 
all the problems in America. [Laughter] But this is pretty close to 
fixing the float breaking down, don't you think?

    I want to make sure that I have properly acknowledged all the groups 
that are here, so I want to call your names, and you raise your hand if 
you're in one of these groups. Who's here from the Sounds of Silence in 
Canton, Ohio? [Applause] Thank you. I'd also like to say I'm glad to see 
Senators Glenn and Metzenbaum here. Give them a hand. [Applause] Who's 
here from the Boy Singers of Maine? [Applause] From my alma mater, the 
Georgetown Chimes? [Applause] And the Georgetown Grace Notes? [Applause] 
And from Hillary's alma mater, the Wellesley Widows? [Applause]

    Hillary Clinton. Just two left. They all had to go back to school.

    The President. Two hung in there to be represented tonight. 
[Laughter] I'm very sorry about what happened yesterday, but I'm glad 
you're all here today.

    Anybody want to sing me a quick song?

    Hillary Clinton. Let's start in order.

    The President. All right, we'll start in order. The Sounds of 
Silence go first.

Note: The President spoke at 6:45 p.m. on the State Floor at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
