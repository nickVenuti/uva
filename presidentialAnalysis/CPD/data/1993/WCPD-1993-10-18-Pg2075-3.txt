Statement by the Director of Communications on the Death of Justice 
Minister Guy Malary of Haiti

 October 15, 1993

    The President strongly condemns the killing of Haitian Minister of 
Justice Guy Malary, a desperate attempt to thwart the will of the 
Haitian people for democracy. The United States remains firmly committed 
to the Governors Island accord and the return to Haiti of President 
Aristide. The President is currently meeting with his advisers on the 
situation.
