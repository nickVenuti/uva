Nomination for Deputy Director of the Peace Corps

 September 16, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate U.S. 
Ambassador to the Republic of Djibouti, Charles R. Baquet III, a former 
Peace Corps volunteer, as Deputy Director of the Peace Corps.
    ``Like Peace Corps Director Carol Bellamy, Charles Baquet is a 
former volunteer who knows firsthand the possibilities and problems 
facing the Peace Corps,'' the President said. ``I am confident his 
experiences both as a volunteer and as a Foreign Service officer will 
serve him well as he works to ensure the Peace Corps meets its mission 
of helping others around the world.''
