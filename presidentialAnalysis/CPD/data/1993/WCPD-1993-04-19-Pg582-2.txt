    ``The National Endowment for the Humanities plays a vital role in 
encouraging and enhancing a better understanding of our country's rich 
heritage,'' said the President. ``Doing just that has been the work of 
Sheldon Hackney's life. Likewise, Michael Shapiro has demonstrated true 
ability in the management of cultural institutions. I am confident that 
the NEH will flourish in their hands.''
