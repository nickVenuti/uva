Management and Budget (OMB) for fiscal years 1994 through 1997. The

that reflect no less than a 3 percent reduction in administrative 
expenses from the amount made available for fiscal year 1993 adjusted 
for inflation;
    (b) For fiscal year 1995, all agencies shall submit budget requests 
that reflect no less than a 6 percent reduction in administrative 
expenses from the amounts made available for fiscal year 1993 adjusted 
for inflation;
    (c) For fiscal year 1996, all agencies shall submit budget requests 
that reflect no less than a 9 percent reduction in administrative 
expenses from the amounts made available for fiscal year 1993 adjusted

that reflect no less than a 14 percent reduction in administrative 
expenses from the amounts made available for fiscal year 1993 adjusted 
for inflation.
    Sec. 3. The Director shall review agency requests for administrative 
expenses. The Director shall ensure that all agency requests for such 
expenses are reduced in accordance with section 2. To the extent that 
any agency fails to comply with the mandates of section 2, the Director 
is authorized to reduce the request for administrative expenses in that 
agency's budget to achieve the appropriate reduction.
    Sec. 4. All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are 
requested to comply with the provisions of this order.
