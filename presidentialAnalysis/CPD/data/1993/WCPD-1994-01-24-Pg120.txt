Letter on the Withdrawal of Nomination of Admiral Bobby R. Inman to be 
Secretary of Defense

January 18, 1993

Dear Admiral Inman:

    It is with regret that I accept your request that I not submit your 
nomination as Secretary of Defense. While I understand the personal 
considerations that have led you to this decision, I am nevertheless 
saddened that our Nation will be denied your service.
    I wish you the very best as you continue to work on your many 
important endeavors as a private citizen.
    Very truly yours,
                                                  Bill Clinton

Note: The White House also made available Adm. Inman's letter requesting 
that his nomination to be Secretary of Defense be withdrawn.
