    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Phillip N. 
Diehl, until recently the Chief of Staff at the Department of the 
Treasury, to be the Director of the U.S. Mint.
    ``As a senior member of Secretary Bentsen's staff, both in the 
Senate and at the Treasury, and during his service in Texas' State 
Government, Phil Diehl has distinguished himself as a public servant of 
high quality,'' said the President. ``He has the skills and experience 
that it takes to be an effective manager of the U.S. Mint.''
