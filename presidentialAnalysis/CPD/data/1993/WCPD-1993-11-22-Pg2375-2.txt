Appointment of Members of the Federal Council on the Aging

 November 15, 1993

    The President announced today that he will appoint four new members 
to the Federal Council on the Aging, a 15-member panel that advises and 
assists the President on matters relating to the special needs of older 
Americans. The President appoints one-third of the Council's members, 
three of whom must be more than 60 years of age.
    ``The senior citizen community, our parents and grandparents, is one 
of our great resources,'' said the President. ``It is important that we 
ensure that Government policies are helpful to them and that we make 
sure to seek their wisdom as we decide on those policies.''
    The members appointed today are Alice B. Bulos, William B. Cashin, 
Olivia P. Maynard, and Myrtle B. Pickering.

Note: Biographies of the appointees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
