Statement on the Death of Arthur Ashe

 February 7, 1993

    I am deeply saddened by the death last night of Arthur Ashe. The 
embodiment of true sportsmanship, Arthur rose from the segregated courts 
of Richmond, VA, to the championship at Wimbledon displaying grace, 
strength, and courage every step of the way.
    Arthur Ashe never rested with fame. He used the strength of his 
voice and the power of his example to open the doors of opportunity for 
other African-Americans, fighting discrimination in America and around 
the world.
    In the last years of his life he continued his tenacious battle for 
others in the face of a disease he could not beat. He was a true 
American hero and a great example to us all.
