Statement on the Death of President Ranasinghe Premadasa of Sri Lanka

 May 1, 1993

    I am outraged by the assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa 
of Sri Lanka. I condemn this brutal act of terrorism.
    President Premadasa served his country with great distinction. As 
Prime Minister and then as President, he worked tirelessly to promote 
his country's development and raise the standard of living of all Sri 
Lankans. His efforts made a real difference to his fellow citizens.
    I hope that the people of Sri Lanka will join together at this 
difficult time to renew their commitment to the fight against terrorism 
and to underscore their support for their democratic institutions.
    Hillary and I wish to extend the sympathy of the American people to 
the people of Sri Lanka at the loss of their leader. We send our sincere 
condolences to the family of President Premadasa at this tragic time.
