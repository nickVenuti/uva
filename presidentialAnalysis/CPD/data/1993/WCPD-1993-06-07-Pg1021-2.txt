Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Albania, Romania, and 
Certain States of the Former Soviet Union

 June 3, 1993

Dear Mr. Speaker:    (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit the documents referred to in section 402(d)(1) of 
the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2432(d)(1)) (``the Act''), 
with respect to a further 12-month extension of the authority to waive 
sections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act. These documents 
constitute my recommendation to continue in effect the waiver authority 
for a further 12-month period, and include my reasons for determining 
that continuation of the waiver authority and waivers currently in 
effect for Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan will substantially promote the 
objectives of section 402 of the Act.
    Sincerely,
                                                  Bill Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
