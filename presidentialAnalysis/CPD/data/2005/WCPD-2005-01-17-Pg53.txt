Subject: Extension of Waiver of Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act 
with respect to Assistance to the Government of Azerbaijan

    Pursuant to the authority contained in title II of the Kenneth M. 
Ludden Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 2002 (Public Law 107-115), I hereby determine and 
certify that extending the waiver of section 907 of the FREEDOM Support 
Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-511):
<bullet>    is necessary to support United States efforts to counter 
            international terrorism;
<bullet>    is necessary to support the operational readiness of United 
            States Armed Forces or coalition partners to counter 
            international terrorism;
<bullet>    is important to Azerbaijan's border security; and
<bullet>    will not undermine or hamper ongoing efforts to negotiate a 
            peaceful settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan or be 
            used for offensive purposes against Armenia.
    Accordingly, I hereby extend the waiver of section 907 of the 
FREEDOM Support Act.
    You are authorized and directed to notify the Congress of this 
determination and to arrange for its publication in the Federal 
Register.
                                                George W. Bush
