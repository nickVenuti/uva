    Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance 
Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that 
it is important to the national interest that up to $34.7 million be 
made available from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance 
Fund to support unexpected urgent humanitarian needs in the West Bank 
and Gaza, and refugee repatriation to Burundi and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. These funds may be used, as appropriate, to 
provide contributions to international, governmental, and 
nongovernmental organizations, and, as necessary, for administrative 
expenses of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.
    You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees 
of the Congress of this determination and the obligation of funds under 
this authority, and to arrange for the publication of this memorandum in 
the Federal Register.
