Statement on House of Representatives Action on Bankruptcy Reform 
Legislation

April 14, 2005

    I commend the House for acting in bipartisan fashion to curb abuses 
of the bankruptcy system. These commonsense reforms will make the system 
stronger and better so that more Americans--especially lower-income 
Americans--have greater access to credit. I look forward to signing the 
bill into law.
