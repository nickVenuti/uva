Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Giving 
Notification of Intent To Reallocate Funds Previously Transferred From 
the Emergency Response Fund

May 27, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds 
previously transferred from the Emergency Response Fund (ERF).
    To promote democracy and freedom, $7.7 million of ERF funds will be 
reallocated within the Broadcasting Board of Governors to support the 
operational costs of Arabic radio and television broadcasting to the 
Middle East.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
    Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
