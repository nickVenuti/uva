Remarks Following a Church Service in Beijing, China

November 20, 2005

    Pastor, Laura and I thank you very much for your hospitality. Our 
friend Luis Palau from America, is here as well. You gave a great 
sermon. The spirit of the Lord is very strong inside your church. We 
thank you for carrying a message of love, like you did.
    You know, it wasn't all that long ago that people were not allowed 
to worship openly in this society. My hope is that the Government of 
China will not fear Christians who gather to worship openly. A healthy 
society is a society that welcomes all faiths and gives people a chance 
to express themselves through worship with the Almighty. So we welcome--
we really thank you for letting us come by, and we ask for God's 
blessing.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 8:22 a.m. at Gangwashi Protestant Church. 
In his remarks, he referred to Ying Dufeng, pastor, Gangwashi Protestant 
Church; and Luis Palau, founder, Luis Palau Association. A tape was not
