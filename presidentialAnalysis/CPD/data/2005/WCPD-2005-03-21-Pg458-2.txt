Statement on the Terri Schiavo Case

March 17, 2005

    The case of Terri Schiavo raises complex issues. Yet in instances 
like this one, where there are serious questions and substantial doubts, 
our society, our laws, and our courts should have a presumption in favor 
of life. Those who live at the mercy of others deserve our special care 
and concern. It should be our goal as a nation to build a culture of 
life, where all Americans are valued, welcomed, and protected--and that 
culture of life must extend to individuals with disabilities.
