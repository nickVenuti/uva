 Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation To Reduce 
Federal Spending

 November 18, 2005

     I applaud the Republican Members of the House who passed a 
significant savings package that will restrain spending and keep us on 
track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. We will continue to fund our 
priorities in a fiscally responsible way and ensure that taxpayer money 
is spent wisely or not spent at all. I urge the House and Senate to 
reach agreement promptly on a spending-reduction package that I can sign 
into law this year.
