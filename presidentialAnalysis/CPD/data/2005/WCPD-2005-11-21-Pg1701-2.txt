Statement on the Agriculture Appropriations Bill

November 10, 2005

    The agriculture appropriations bill meets important priorities and 
holds spending below last year's level. This legislation is an important 
step forward in our efforts to rein in spending while maintaining our 
commitment to America's farmers and consumers. By pursuing progrowth 
economic policies and restraining spending, we can stay on track to meet 
my goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009.
