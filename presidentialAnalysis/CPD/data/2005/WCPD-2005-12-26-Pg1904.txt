Statement on Senate Action To Extend the PATRIOT Act

December 21, 2005

    I appreciate the Senate for working to keep the existing PATRIOT Act 
in law through next July, despite boasts last week by the Democratic 
leader that he had blocked the Act. No one should be allowed to block 
the PATRIOT Act to score political points, and I am grateful the Senate 
rejected that approach. The terrorists want to attack our country again 
and inflict even greater damage than they did on September 11, 2001. The 
PATRIOT Act is a vital tool for America in the war on terror. The Act 
has torn down the wall between law enforcement and intelligence 
officials to help us connect the dots and prevent attacks. The work of 
Congress on the PATRIOT Act is not finished. The Act will expire next 
summer, but the terrorist threat to America will not expire on that 
schedule. I look forward to continuing to work with Congress to 
reauthorize the PATRIOT Act.
