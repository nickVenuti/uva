Statement on Senate Action on Energy Legislation

November 3, 2005

    Increasing our domestic energy supply will help lower gasoline 
prices and utility bills. We can and should produce more crude oil here 
at home in environmentally responsible ways. The most promising site for 
oil in America is a 2,000 acre site in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge, and thanks to technology, we can reach this energy with little 
impact on the land or wildlife. I applaud the Senate for passing 
legislation to improve our energy situation with this commonsense 
approach.
