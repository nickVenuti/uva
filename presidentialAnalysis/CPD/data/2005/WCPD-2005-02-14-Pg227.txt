Statement on Senate Action on Class-Action Lawsuit Reform Legislation

February 10, 2005

    Our country depends on a fair legal system that protects people who 
have been harmed without encouraging junk lawsuits that undermine 
confidence in our courts while hurting our economy, costing jobs, and 
threatening small businesses. The class-action bill is a strong step 
forward in our efforts to reform the litigation system and keep America 
the best place in the world to do business. I applaud the strong 
bipartisan majority in the Senate for passing this bill, and I call on 
the House to act promptly so that I can sign it into law.
