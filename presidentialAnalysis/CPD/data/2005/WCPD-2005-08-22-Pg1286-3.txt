Statement on Iraqi Progress Toward a Draft Constitution

August 15, 2005

    Iraqi leaders have announced that they have made substantial 
progress toward a draft constitution. They have indicated that their 
deliberations will continue beyond today to refine the text and build an 
enduring consensus. I applaud the heroic efforts of Iraqi negotiators 
and appreciate their work to resolve remaining issues through continued 
negotiation and dialog. Their efforts are a tribute to democracy and an 
example that difficult problems can be solved peacefully through debate, 
negotiation, and compromise. We wish the Iraqi leaders and the Iraqi 
people well as the negotiators complete the constitutional drafting 
process.
