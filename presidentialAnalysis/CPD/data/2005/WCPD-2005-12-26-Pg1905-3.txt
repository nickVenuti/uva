Statement on Congressional Action Funding the Armed Forces for the War 
on Terror in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Elsewhere

December 22, 2005

    I applaud the Congress for passing legislation to fund our troops 
who are fighting the war on terror in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. 
This funding will help us continue to hunt down the terrorists, pursue 
our strategy for victory in Iraq, and make America more secure. I look 
forward to signing the bill into law.
