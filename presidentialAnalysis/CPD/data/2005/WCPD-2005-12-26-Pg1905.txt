Statement on the Senate Vote To Reduce Entitlement Spending

December 21, 2005

    The Senate vote to reduce entitlement spending is a victory for 
taxpayers, fiscal restraint, and responsible budgeting, and it will help 
keep us on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. I applaud the 
Republicans in the House and Senate who supported the legislation. This 
will be the first time in nearly a decade that Congress has reduced 
entitlement spending. This strong bill demonstrates our commitment to 
funding our Nation's priorities and ensuring that taxpayer money is 
spent wisely.
