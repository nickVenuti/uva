Statement on the Resignation of 
N. Gregory Mankiw as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers

February 17, 2005

    Greg Mankiw has been a trusted member of my economic team and a 
close adviser. His wise and principled counsel over the past 2 years has 
helped shape policies that today are fueling our economic growth. I am 
grateful to Greg for his service to our country, and I wish him, 
Deborah, and the Mankiw family all the best.
