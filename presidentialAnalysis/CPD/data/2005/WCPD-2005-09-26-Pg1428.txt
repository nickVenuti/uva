Statement on the Parliamentary Elections in Afghanistan

September 18, 2005

    I congratulate the Afghan people and Afghan Government for today's 
successful parliamentary elections, which are a major step forward in 
Afghanistan's development as a democratic state governed by the rule of 
law. Braving deadly attacks and threats of violence, Afghans voted in 
large numbers for representatives to their new National Assembly and 
Provincial Councils. We commend the tremendous progress that the Afghan 
people have made in recent years, and we pledge the full support of the 
United States as Afghanistan acts to meet the new challenges ahead.
