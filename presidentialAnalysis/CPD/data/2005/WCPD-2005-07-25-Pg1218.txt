Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments

July 22, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2006 budget 
amendments for the Department of Homeland Security. These proposals 
support the Department's organizational restructuring plan, which 
Secretary Chertoff transmitted to the Congress on July 13. Overall, the 
discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2006 Budget would not 
be increased by this reorganization proposal.
    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
    Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: An original was not available for verification of the content of
