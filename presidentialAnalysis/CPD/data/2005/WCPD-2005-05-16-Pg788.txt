Statement on Congressional Action on the Proposed ``Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, 
and Tsunami Relief, 2005''

May 10, 2005

    I applaud the Congress for its strong bipartisan support for our 
troops and our continued effort to win the war on terror. New 
democracies are taking root in Iraq and Afghanistan, and America is 
proud to stand with them. This legislation will help America continue to 
promote freedom and democracy. It also will assist in the continuing 
tsunami recovery efforts. I appreciate the leadership in the House and 
Senate for working together to reach a final agreement that focuses 
taxpayer dollars on providing our troops and diplomats with the tools 
they need. I look forward to signing the bill into law.
