Joint Statement by President George W. Bush and President Vladimir V. 
Putin: Russia's Accession to the World Trade Organization

February 24, 2005

    The United States and Russia are committed to working together to 
complete our bilateral negotiations for Russia's accession to the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005. The results of the negotiations will 
enhance commercial opportunities between our two countries, support 
economic reforms that Russia has made a priority, and further integrate 
Russia into the world economy. Our trade ministers have made progress in 
pursuing our bilateral negotiations, and we have instructed them to 
accelerate these efforts.
    Russia and the United States will continue to work closely in 
bilateral and multilateral negotiations to resolve remaining issues in 
ways that benefit both countries. The rules-based system of the WTO will 
further strengthen our economic relationship in all areas, including 
agriculture, manufacturing, services, and the improved protection and 
enforcement of intellectual property rights.
    We will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral 
negotiations that will give momentum to Russia's accession to the WTO 
and to Russia's economic reform program.
