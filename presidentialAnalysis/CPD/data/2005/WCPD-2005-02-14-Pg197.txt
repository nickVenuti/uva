Message on the Observance of the Lunar New Year, 2005

February 8, 2005

    I send greetings to those celebrating the Lunar New Year, the Year 
of the Rooster.
    For many Asian Americans, the Lunar New Year is a special time of 
thanksgiving and celebration. It has long been an opportunity for 
families to honor the past and welcome the future. In marking this 
special occasion, you help preserve your rich heritage and ensure that 
your values of family, faith,

and respect for tradition are passed on to future generations. This 
observance also reminds all Americans of the unique fabric that makes up 
our country and the diversity that has made our Nation stronger and 
better.
    Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for peace and prosperity 
in the New Year.
                                                George W. Bush
