Message to the Congress Extending the Period of Production of the Naval 
Petroleum Reserve

October 4, 2005

To the Congress of the United States:

    Consistent with section 7422(c)(2) of title 10, United States Code, 
I am informing you of my decision to extend the period of production of 
the Naval Petroleum Reserves for a period of 3 years from April 5, 2006, 
the expiration date of the currently authorized period of production.
    Attached is a copy of the report prepared by my Administration 
investigating the necessity of continued production of the reserves 
consistent with section 7422(c)(2)(B) of title 10. In light of the 
findings contained in the report, I certify that continued production 
from the Naval Petroleum Reserves is in the national interest.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
