Statement on Death of Carroll Campbell

December 7, 2005

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the loss of Governor Carroll 
Campbell. Carroll Campbell was a strong leader, a committed public 
servant, and a good friend. For more than two decades, he represented 
the people of South Carolina as a State legislator, Member of Congress, 
and Governor. He was a tireless advocate for the State he loved and was 
known for his integrity and character. We join South Carolinians and 
Americans around the Nation in mourning the passing of Carroll Campbell, 
and we send our thoughts and prayers to Iris and the entire Campbell 
family.
