Remarks on the Death of Peter Jennings in Waco, Texas

August 8, 2005

    Laura and I were saddened to learn about the death of Peter 
Jennings. Peter Jennings had a long and distinguished career as a news 
journalist. He covered many important events, events that helped define 
the world as we know it today. A lot of Americans relied upon Peter 
Jennings for their news. He became a part of the lives of a lot of our 
fellow citizens, and he will be missed. May God bless his soul.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 9:52 a.m. at Texas State Technical College.
