Message to the Congress on the National Emergency Caused by Hurricane 
Katrina

September 8, 2005

To the Congress of the United States:

    I hereby report that I have exercised my statutory authority under 
section 6 of the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 276a-5, to suspend the 
provisions of sections 276a to 276a-5 of the Davis-Bacon Act in the 
event of a national emergency. I have found that the conditions caused 
by Hurricane Katrina constitute a ``national emergency'' within the 
meaning of section 6. I have, therefore, suspended the provisions of the 
Davis-Bacon Act in designated areas in the States of Alabama, Florida, 
Louisiana, and Mississippi.
    This action is more fully set out in the enclosed proclamation that 
I have issued today.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 September 8, 2005.
