Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments

May 5, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2006 budget 
amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and 
Human Services, Justice, and the Treasury; and the United States-Canada 
Alaska Rail Commission. Overall, the discretionary budget authority 
proposed in my FY 2006 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
    This transmittal also contains FY 2006 budget amendments and an FY 
2005 proposal for the legislative branch. As a matter of comity, 
appropriations requests of the legislative branch are commonly 
transmitted without change.
    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
