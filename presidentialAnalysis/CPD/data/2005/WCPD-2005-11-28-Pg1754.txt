Remarks Prior to Discussions With Premier Wen Jiabao of China in Beijing

November 20, 2005

    Thank you. It's good to see you again, sir. I remember our visit 
very well. And I thank you for this invitation to come and talk and have 
lunch. It will give us a chance to continue to strengthen this very 
important relationship. And I agree with you; it's a relationship where 
we've got common interests. We don't agree on every issue, but we do 
agree we should discuss our differences and our likenesses in a cordial 
manner.
    And so I look forward to this meeting a lot. Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 1:07 p.m. at the Diaoyutai Guest House. A
