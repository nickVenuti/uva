Statement on Senate Confirmation of Thomas B. Griffith as a United 
States Appeals Court Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit

June 14, 2005

    I commend the Senate for confirming Tom Griffith to the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Tom is an 
accomplished and experienced lawyer who will bring a broad range of 
legal experience to the court. He has served in the important post of 
Senate Legal Counsel, as general counsel at a major university, and in 
private practice. I look forward to the Senate's prompt consideration 
and up-or-down votes for my other judicial nominees.
