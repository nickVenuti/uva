Remarks Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel 
in New York City

September 14, 2005

    President Bush. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. I'm looking forward 
to our meeting. I've said several times publicly that I am inspired by 
your courageous decision to give peace a chance. And I know it was hard, 
but I admire your courage. And I look forward to talking to you about 
how we can get on the roadmap.
    One thing is essential, and the world must hear, that now is the 
time for Palestinians to come together and establish a Government that 
will be peaceful with Israel. And the Gaza is a good chance to start, 
and I know that the Israeli Government wants to see that happen as well.
    The world needs to help the Palestinians. The Arab neighbors need to 
help the Palestinians develop an economy. Now is the time for people to 
step up. It's an opportunity that was created by a bold decision, and I 
want to work together to see the vision of peace come to be.
    So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for being here.
    Prime Minister Sharon. Thank you. Mr. President, I'm glad to meet 
with you again. I'm glad that we are working together in order to 
achieve peace in the region.
    President Bush. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:22 a.m. at the United Nations 
Headquarters. A tape was not available for verification of the content
