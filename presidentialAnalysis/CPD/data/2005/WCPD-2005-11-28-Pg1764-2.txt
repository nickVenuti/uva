Message on the First Anniversary of the Orange Revolution

November 22, 2005

    I send greetings to those celebrating the first anniversary of the 
Orange Revolution.
    One year ago today, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens 
stood up to defend democracy in their homeland. Through great courage 
and determination, they showed the world that the love of liberty is 
stronger than the will of tyranny. Last year's revolution was a powerful 
example of freedom and democracy in action and an inspiration to those 
aspiring for freedom in their own land.
    Ukraine's leadership now faces an historic opportunity and has an 
historic responsibility to fulfill the promise of the Orange Revolution 
and continue to transform Ukraine into a fully democratic state. The 
United States will continue to support the efforts of President Viktor 
Yushchenko in advancing a democratic, prosperous, and secure Ukraine, 
and America is proud to call Ukraine a friend.
    Laura and I send our best wishes on this special occasion.
                                                George W. Bush
