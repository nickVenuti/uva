Statement on the Earthquake in Pakistan

October 8, 2005

    The people of the United States offer our deepest sympathies for the 
loss of life and destruction caused by the earthquake that struck 
outside of Islamabad. Our initial deployments of assistance are 
underway, and we stand ready to provide additional assistance as needed. 
My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this horrible 
tragedy.
