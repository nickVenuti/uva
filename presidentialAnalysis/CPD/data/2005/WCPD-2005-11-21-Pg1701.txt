Remarks After Signing the Book of Condolence at the Jordanian Embassy

November 10, 2005

    Mr. Ambassador, thank you for receiving us. We have come to your 
Embassy to express our heartfelt sympathies for the people of Jordan and 
for the families who are grieving today because of the murder of 
innocent people.
    I spoke to His Majesty this morning and conveyed these very same 
thoughts. And during my conversation, as he described the fact that 
these bombers went into a wedding and killed people there that were 
there to celebrate life, killed innocent--the bombers killed innocent 
women and children, it struck me, Mr. Ambassador, that--once again, that 
we face an enemy that has no heart, an enemy that is defiling a great 
religion, of Islam. Today--yesterday in Jordan, Muslims died at the 
hands of these killers simply because they were in the wrong hotel, 
simply because they wanted to be with their families and enjoy life.
    This enemy must be defeated. They have no heart. They have no 
conscience.
    I want to thank you and the good people of Jordan for standing 
strong against these merciless killers. And we ask for God's blessings 
on the people of Jordan.

Note: The President spoke at 4:27 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Ambassador Karim Tawfiq Kawar and King Abdullah II of Jordan. This item
