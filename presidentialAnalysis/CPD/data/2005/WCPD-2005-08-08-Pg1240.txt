Statement on the Death of King Fahd bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi 
Arabia

August 1, 2005

    I was deeply saddened to learn today of the death of King Fahd bin 
Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and King of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. King Fahd was a man of wisdom and a leader who 
commanded respect throughout the entire world. He was a friend and 
strong ally of the United States for decades. As King, he had warm 
friendships with American Presidents. I send my condolences and those of 
the American people to King Abdallah, to the late King Fahd's family, 
and to the Saudi people on the passing of this historic figure. May God 
bless him.
