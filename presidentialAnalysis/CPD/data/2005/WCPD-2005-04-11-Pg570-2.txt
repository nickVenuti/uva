Statement on the Death of Prince Rainier III of Monaco

April 6, 2005

    Laura and I join Americans across the country in mourning the loss 
of His Serene Highness Prince Rainier III of Monaco. He will be 
remembered as a respected leader who secured the prosperity of Monaco's 
people. Monaco and the United States have long had a special bond of 
friendship. We extend our deepest condolences to His Serene Highness 
Prince Albert, to the Grimaldi family, and to all the people of Monaco.
