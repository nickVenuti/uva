Statement on Congressional Action on Homeland Security Legislation

October 7, 2005

    I applaud the Congress for its work on the homeland security 
legislation. The resources provided by this bill will help us protect 
our borders, upgrade explosives detection technology in our airports, 
address radiological and nuclear threats, and target security funding to 
areas with the greatest need. The legislation will help make our 
homeland more secure.
