Statement on the Inauguration of the Afghan National Assembly

December 19, 2005

    I congratulate the Afghan people on the inauguration of the new 
Afghan national assembly. Today is another milestone in Afghanistan's 
historic transition to a stable and democratic state governed by the 
rule of law. A freely and fairly elected legislature plays a vital role 
in the life of a representative democracy. I applaud the members of the 
national assembly on their service to their country and support their 
efforts, with President Karzai and his Government, to improve the lives 
of the Afghan people.
