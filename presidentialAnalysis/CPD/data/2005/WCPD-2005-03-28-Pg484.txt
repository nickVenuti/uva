Statement on Signing Legislation for the Relief of the Parents of 
Theresa Marie Schiavo

March 21, 2005

    Today I signed into law a bill that will allow Federal courts to 
hear a claim by or on behalf of Terri Schiavo for violation of her 
rights relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or 
medical treatment necessary to sustain her life. In cases like this one, 
where there are serious questions and substantial doubts, our society, 
our laws, and our courts should have a presumption in favor of life. 
This presumption is especially critical for those like Terri Schiavo who 
live at the mercy of others. I appreciate the bipartisan action by the 
Members of Congress to pass this bill. I will continue to stand on the 
side of those defending life for all Americans, including those with 
disabilities.

 Note: The statement referred to S. 686, which was assigned Public Law 
No. 109-3.
