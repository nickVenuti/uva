Statement on Congressional Action To Reauthorize the PATRIOT Act

December 22, 2005

    I appreciate the strong commitment by the majority of the House and 
of the Senate to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. The terrorists are 
determined to strike America again and inflict even greater damage than 
they did on September 11, 2001. The PATRIOT Act is essential to 
protecting the American people against the terrorists. The Act tore down 
the wall between law enforcement and intelligence officials so that they 
can share information and work together to help prevent

attacks. The Senate Democratic leader boasted last week that the Senate 
Democrats had ``killed the PATRIOT Act.'' Our Nation's security must be 
above partisan politics. The PATRIOT Act has helped us disrupt terrorist 
plots and break up cells here in the United States. I will work closely 
with the House and Senate to make sure that we are not without this 
crucial law for even a day.
