Presidential Determination No. 2005-30

Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense

Subject: Drawdown of Commodities and Services from the Department of 
Defense to Support African Union Peacekeeping in Darfur, Sudan.

    Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States, including section 552(c)(2) of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I hereby determine that:
(1)          as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of 
            assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts 
            in excess of funds otherwise available for such assistance 
            is important to the national interests of the United States; 
            and
(2)          such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision 
            of assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
    I therefore direct the drawdown of up to $6 million in commodities 
and services from the Department of Defense to support the 
transportation of African Union forces to Darfur, Sudan.
    The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this 
determination to the Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.
                                                George W. Bush
