Statement on the Death of First Vice President Dr. John Garang de Mabior 
of Sudan

August 1, 2005

    I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Sudanese First Vice 
President Dr. John Garang de Mabior. He was a visionary leader and 
peacemaker who helped bring about the comprehensive peace agreement, 
which is a beacon of hope for all Sudanese. The United States is 
determined to maintain our commitment to the peace process in Sudan. We 
urge all Sudanese people to refrain from resorting to violence and to 
continue the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement. John 
Garang's vision of peace must be embraced by all the people in Sudan so 
that they can live in a democratic, peaceful, and united country. On 
behalf of the people of the United States, Laura and I extend our 
deepest sympathies to Dr. Garang's wife, Rebecca, his family, and to all 
the people of Sudan.
