Remarks During Visit to a ``Toys for Tots'' Collection Center

December 19, 2005

    The President. Two-hundred-eighty-nine-thousand toys being 
distributed from here to children throughout DC.
    It's an interesting process. The toys are collected; the Marines 
sort with DC police and distribute. Is that right?
    Volunteer. Yes.
    The President. Thanks for doing this--a great part of the compassion 
of our country. Now, I told our troops that, one, we're a great 
military; we're great because of the men and women who serve; we're 
great because of our strength. We're also great because they're decent 
people who care about a neighbor in need.
    So Laura and I are thrilled to be here. Thank you all for your 
service. We're getting to work.

Note: The President spoke at 3:18 p.m. at the Naval District Washington 
Anacostia Annex.
