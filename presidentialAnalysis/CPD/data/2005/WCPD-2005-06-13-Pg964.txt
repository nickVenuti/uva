Statement on Senate Confirmation of Janice R. Brown as United States 
Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit

June 8, 2005

    I commend the Senate for voting to confirm Justice Janice Rogers 
Brown. During her tenure on the California Supreme Court and California 
Court of Appeal, Justice Brown has distinguished herself as a brilliant 
and fair-minded jurist who is committed to the rule of law. Justice 
Brown exemplifies the American dream of personal achievement and 
excellence, and she will be a great asset to the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
