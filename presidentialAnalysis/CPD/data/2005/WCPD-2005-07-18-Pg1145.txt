Remarks Upon Signing the Book of Condolence at the Embassy of the United 
Kingdom

July 8, 2005

    President Bush. Yesterday was an incredibly sad day for a lot of 
families in London. It's my honor, Ambassador, to come and represent our 
great country in extending our condolences to the--to the people of 
Great Britain. To those who suffer loss of life, we pray for God's 
blessings. For those who are injured, we pray for fast healing. The 
British people are steadfast and strong. Long we've admired the great 
spirit of the--of Londoners and the people of Great Britain. Once again 
that great strength of character is coming through.
    Thank you, Ambassador, for letting me come by.
    Ambassador David Manning of the United Kingdom. You're welcome. Mr. 
President, could I just say thank you very much, sir, for coming 
straight here from the airplane after the summit at the G-8. It's 
enormously good of you to come here. The gesture is hugely appreciated. 
And can I say to you that we have had the most wonderful gestures of 
support from the Americans over the last 36 hours. We're very grateful 
for that. It's a huge source of comfort, and thank you so much for 
coming today.
    President Bush. Yes, sir.
