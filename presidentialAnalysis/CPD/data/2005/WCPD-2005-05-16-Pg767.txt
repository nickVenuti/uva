Riga, Latvia

    Madam President, I gratefully accept. I am so honored and so 
thrilled to be here in your beautiful country.
    I was telling the President that it's such a joy to come to a 
country that loves and values freedom and to be in the presence of a 
President who speaks so clearly about the need for people to be free and 
her recognition that a free world will yield peace.
    And so Madam President, thank you for your hospitality, and thank 
you so much for this great honor. Appreciate it.

Note: The President spoke at 9:55 a.m. at Riga Castle. In his remarks, 
he referred to President Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia. A tape was not
