Remarks Following Discussions With President Vaira Vike-Freiberga of 
Latvia in Riga

May 7, 2005

    President Vike-Freiberga. We are, of course, very gratified for this 
sudden interest in Latvia that we're seeing among the journalists. 
[Laughter] And it's truly a great pleasure to see these wonderful 
journalists coming to my country and having a look around. And Mr. 
President, I think that you have something to do with that. [Laughter]
    President Bush. Well, thank you for having us, Madam President. It's 
been a trip I've really been anxious to fulfill. I admire your 
leadership; I admire your country's courage. I love the fact that you're 
a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom. So, 
thanks for the hospitality.
    President Vike-Freiberga. And we're pleased that the cameras are now 
turned on Latvia while you are here. [Laughter]
    President Bush. That's right.
    Q. Mr. President----
    President Bush. Thank you all. We'll have ample opportunity in an 
open press conference. And I certainly wouldn't want you to fire your 
best question here. [Laughter]

Note: The President spoke at approximately 11:10 a.m. at Riga Castle. A 
tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
