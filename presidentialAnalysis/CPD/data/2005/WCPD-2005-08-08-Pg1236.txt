President's Health/Visit With Marines

    The President. I just finished two things. One, I had my physical, 
and I'm feeling pretty good. It's a great hospital to come to to get 
your physical.
    But I also visited with some brave marines who have been wounded. 
It's a remarkable experience to meet with these incredibly courageous 
souls who keep their spirit. And I understand why they're serving the 
country. I met with their parents. I met with the healers who work here 
at Bethesda. It's a--it's such a great credit to our country to have a 
place such as this.
    So I want to thank you for having me, and thanks for giving me my 
physical.
    Rear Adm. Robinson. Your welcome, sir.
    The President. Thank you.
    Q. How's your health, sir?
    The President. She's going to put out the return. I think you'll 
find it's pretty good. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 12:16 p.m. Participating in the visit was 
Rear Adm. Adam M. Robinson, Jr., USN, commander, National Naval Medical 
Center. A tape was not available for verification of the content of
