Statement on Signing the Energy and Water Development Appropriations 
Act, 2006

November 19, 2005

    I have signed into law H.R. 2419, the ``Energy and Water Development 
Appropriations Act, 2006.'' The Act funds programs of the Department of 
Energy, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, the Army 
Corps of Engineers, and several other agencies, and provides funds to 
help protect the Nation's environment.
    The executive branch shall construe sections 101 and 303 of the Act 
as calling for, but not mandating, consultation with the Congress as a 
precondition to the execution of a law, as is consistent with the 
Constitution's provisions concerning the separate powers of the Congress 
to legislate and the President to execute the laws.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 November 19, 2005.

Note: H.R. 2419, approved November 19, was assigned Public Law No. 109-
103. This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
November 20. An original was not available for verification of the
