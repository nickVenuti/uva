Statement on the Birthday of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi

June 17, 2005

    I send my best wishes to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for her 60th birthday, 
June 19. Her strength, courage, and personal sacrifice in standing up 
for the oppressed people of Burma have inspired those who stand for 
freedom. Only a return to democracy and reintegration with the 
international community can bring the freedom and prosperity that the 
people of Burma deserve. The United States looks forward to the time 
when Burma is democratic and free.
