Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Use of 
Emergency Supplemental Appropriations

December 14, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I am notifying the Congress of my intent to use funds provided in 
Public Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for 
Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 
2001, for improvements to the White House Situation Room to enhance the 
capabilities of the White House in the war on terrorism.
    At this time, $3.3 million will be transferred from the Emergency 
Response Fund to the Department of Defense. As provided in Public Law 
107-38, these funds will be made available to the Department of Defense 
immediately.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
