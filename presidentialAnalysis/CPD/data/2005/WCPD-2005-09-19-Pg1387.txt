    I extend my congratulations to Prime Minister Koizumi for his 
decisive victory in yesterday's elections and to the Japanese people for 
continuing Japan's robust democratic tradition. Prime Minister Koizumi 
is a bold leader and a good friend, and I look forward to continuing the 
close partnership between our two countries.
