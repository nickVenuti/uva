Pope Benedict XVI

    Laura and I offer our congratulations to Pope Benedict XVI. He's a 
man of great wisdom and knowledge. He's a man who serves the Lord. We 
remember well his sermon at the Pope's funeral in Rome, how his words 
touched our hearts and the hearts of millions. We join with our fellow 
citizens and millions around the world who pray for continued strength 
and wisdom as His Holiness leads the Catholic Church.
    Thank you all.
