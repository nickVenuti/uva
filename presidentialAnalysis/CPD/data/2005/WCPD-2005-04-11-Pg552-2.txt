 A Proclamation

    As a mark of respect for His Holiness Pope John Paul II, I hereby 
order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the 
United States of America, that the flag of the United States shall be 
flown at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and 
grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval 
vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and 
throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until 
sunset on the day of his interment. I also direct that the flag shall be 
flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, 
legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all 
military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
     In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.
