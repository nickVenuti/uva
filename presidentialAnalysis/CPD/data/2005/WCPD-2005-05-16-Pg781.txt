Statement on the Death of
Lloyd Cutler

May 8, 2005

    Laura and I are saddened by the passing of Lloyd Cutler. Lloyd 
Cutler served our Nation with dedication and distinction throughout his 
extraordinary career, including as Counsel and adviser to President 
Carter and President Clinton, and most recently on the Commission on 
weapons of mass destruction. He was a devoted public servant who had a 
profound influence on the legal profession. Laura and I extend our 
deepest sympathy to his family.
