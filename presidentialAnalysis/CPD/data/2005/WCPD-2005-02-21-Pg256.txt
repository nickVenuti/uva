Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Class Action 
Fairness Act of 2005

February 17, 2005

    I commend the House for passing a class-action reform bill that will 
help protect people who are wrongfully harmed while reducing the 
frivolous lawsuits that clog our courts, hurt the economy, cost jobs, 
and burden American businesses. Junk lawsuits have helped drive the cost 
of America's tort system to more than $240 billion a year, greater than 
any other major industrialized nation. This bill is an important step 
forward in our efforts to reform the litigation system and to continue 
creating jobs and growing our economy. I look forward to signing the 
bill into law.
