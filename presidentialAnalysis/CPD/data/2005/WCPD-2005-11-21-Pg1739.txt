 Remarks Prior to Discussions With President Vladimir Putin of Russia in 
Busan, South Korea

 November 18, 2005

     President Putin. Distinguished Mr. President, allow me to cordially 
welcome you and your colleagues. And I get impression that with some of 
your colleagues, I never said goodbye. [Laughter] And it is very 
pleasant indeed, that these colleagues, we've virtually had permanent 
contacts on almost all bilateral and international issues.
     And I'm especially pleased to have this meeting with you here in 
South Korea. You stayed here for quite a while, and probably will tell 
me of your impressions.
     President Bush. Well, thanks, Vladimir, for hosting this meeting. I 
always enjoy a chance to have a good discussion with you. You're right. 
We've got a very important relationship. We value your advice, and we 
value the strategic relationship we've built. So thanks--thanks again 
for hosting this.

  Note:  The President spoke at 12:16 p.m. at the Busan Marriott. A tape 
was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
