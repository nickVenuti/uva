Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendment for the Department of Veterans Affairs

July 14, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    My Administration is committed to ensuring that our Nation's 
veterans continue to receive timely and high-quality health care. To 
this end, I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed $1.977 billion FY 
2006 budget amendment for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). I am 
requesting these resources to cover the expected increased costs in FY 
2006 that VA will experience in its medical care budget.
    The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
