 Statement on the Innovations in American Government Award

 July 27, 2005

     I am pleased that my administration's Office of Management and 
Budget has received the Kennedy School's Innovation in American 
Government Award for its Program Assessment Rating Tool. I congratulate 
the hard-working employees at OMB for winning this award and 
implementing our management agenda. Taxpayer money should be spent 
wisely or not at all, and I am proud of the progress we have made to 
improve management and focus on results. We are changing the way the 
Federal Government thinks about program management and budgeting. We 
still have work to do, and improving the effectiveness of Government and 
providing good value to taxpayers will continue to be a top priority of 
my administration.
