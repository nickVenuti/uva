Statement on Senate Action on Legislation To Reduce Federal Spending

November 3, 2005


    Today the Senate took an important step forward in cutting the 
deficit. I commend Senate leadership and the other Senators who 
supported this spending reduction legislation, and I congratulate 
Senator Gregg on its successful passage. Congress needs to send me a 
spending reduction package this year to keep us on track to cutting the 
deficit in half by 2009.
