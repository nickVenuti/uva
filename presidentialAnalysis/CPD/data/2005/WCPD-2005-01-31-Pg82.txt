Statement on the Death of
Johnny Carson

January 23, 2005

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Johnny Carson. Born in Iowa 
and raised in Nebraska, Johnny Carson was a steady and reassuring 
presence in homes across America for three decades. His wit and insight 
made Americans laugh and think and had a profound influence on American 
life and entertainment. He was a patriot who served in the United States 
Navy during World War II and always remembered his roots in the 
heartland of America. We send our prayers and condolences to the entire 
Carson family.
