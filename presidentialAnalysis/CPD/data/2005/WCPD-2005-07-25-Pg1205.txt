Statement on House of Representatives Action on the PATRIOT Act

July 21, 2005

    I commend the House for voting to reauthorize provisions of the 
PATRIOT Act that are set to expire this year. The PATRIOT Act has 
enhanced information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence 
personnel, updated the law to adapt to changes in technology, and 
provided critical tools to investigate terrorists that have been used 
for years in cases against organized crime and drug dealers. The PATRIOT 
Act is a key part of our efforts to combat terrorism and protect the 
American people, and the Congress needs to send me a bill soon that 
renews the Act without weakening our ability to fight terror.
