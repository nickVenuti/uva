Statement on Senate Action To Allow for Environmentally Responsible 
Energy Exploration in a Small Part of the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge

March 16, 2005

    I applaud today's vote in the Senate to allow for environmentally 
responsible energy exploration in a small part of the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge. A reliable domestic supply of energy is important to 
America's security and prosperity. This project will keep our economy 
growing by creating jobs and ensuring that businesses can expand. And it 
will make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy, 
eventually by up to a million barrels of oil a day.
    I also call on the Congress to pass a comprehensive national energy 
plan that will diversify supply, increase conservation and efficiency, 
and upgrade our energy infrastructure.
