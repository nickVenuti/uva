Statement on the Tenth Anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombing

April 19, 2005

    The tenth anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing takes us back to 
the terrible tragedy that touched all Americans and took the lives of so 
many from Oklahoma City. We remember the malice that led to the death of 
168 innocent people in the Murrah Federal Building. For the survivors of 
this crime and for the families of the dead, the pain goes on. We also 
remember the many acts of courage and kindness we saw in the midst of 
that horror. Oklahoma City will always be one of those places in our 
national memory where the worst and the best both came to pass. We pray 
for the lives that were lost that day, and we pray for their families. 
We ask God for strength and peace for those who lost so much.
