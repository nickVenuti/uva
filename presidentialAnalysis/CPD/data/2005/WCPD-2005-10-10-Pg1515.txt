Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation To Increase 
Domestic Refining Capacity

October 7, 2005

    I commend the House for passing legislation that would increase our 
refining capacity and help address the cost of gasoline, diesel fuels, 
and jet fuels. No refineries have been built in our Nation since 1976, 
and the recent disruptions in supply from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita 
have demonstrated that additional refining capacity is critically 
needed. We must continue to promote sound energy policy to help keep 
prices down for small businesses and hard-working American families.
