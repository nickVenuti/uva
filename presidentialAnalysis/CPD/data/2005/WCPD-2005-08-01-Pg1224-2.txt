Statement on the Launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery 

July 26, 2005

    On behalf of all Americans, I wish the crew of the Space Shuttle 
Discovery a safe and successful mission. Today's launch marks NASA's 
return to flight following the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia 
crew in February 2003. I thank the men and women of NASA who have 
dedicated themselves to putting our space program back on track. Our 
space program is a source of great national pride, and this flight is an 
essential step toward our goal of continuing to lead the world in space 
science, human space flight, and space exploration.
