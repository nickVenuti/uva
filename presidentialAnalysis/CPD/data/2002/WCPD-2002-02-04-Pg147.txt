Statement on the National Economy

January 30, 2002

    Today's GDP report is positive, but we cannot take growth and job 
creation for granted. For the sake of America's workers, I call on 
Congress to pass an economic security package that will protect American 
jobs and prosperity because I remain concerned about the economy. I'm 
pleased that consumer spending contributed to today's report, 
demonstrating that last year's bipartisan tax relief plan was the right 
thing to do for the American people and the American economy.
