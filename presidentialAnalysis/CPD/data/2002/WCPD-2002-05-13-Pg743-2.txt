Message to the Congress on the Restoration of Normal Trade Relations 
Treatment to the Products of Afghanistan

1985, authorized the President to deny normal trade relations (NTR) 
tariff treatment to the products of Afghanistan. On January 31, 1986, 
President Reagan issued a proclamation denying NTR treatment to 
Afghanistan.
    I have determined that it is appropriate to restore NTR treatment to 
the products of Afghanistan. Restoration of NTR treatment will support 
U.S. efforts to normalize relations with Afghanistan and facilitate

Public Law 99-190, I hereby provide notice that I have issued the

Afghanistan. The Proclamation shall take effect 30 days after it is 
published in the Federal Register.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
