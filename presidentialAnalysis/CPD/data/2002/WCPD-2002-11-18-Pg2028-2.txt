Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Iran

November 12, 2002

To the Congress of the United States:

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date

[[Page 2029]]

of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and 
transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to 
continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this 
provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating that the Iran 
emergency declared by Executive Order 12170 on November 14, 1979, is to 
continue in effect beyond November 14, 2002, to the Federal Register for 
publication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was 
published in the Federal Register on November 13, 2001, (66 FR 56966).
    Our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the 
process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is 
still underway. For these reasons, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national emergency declared on November 14, 
1979, with respect to Iran, beyond November 14, 2002.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 November 12, 2002.
