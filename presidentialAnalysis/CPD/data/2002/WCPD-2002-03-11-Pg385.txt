Statement on Senator Fred Thompson's Decision Not To Seek Reelection

March 8, 2002

    Senator Fred Thompson has served the people of Tennessee with honor, 
distinction, and class. He has worked tirelessly for Tennessee's 
interests, as well as for the national interest. While I will miss 
Fred's service in the Senate, I wish him all the best and will always 
call him a friend.
