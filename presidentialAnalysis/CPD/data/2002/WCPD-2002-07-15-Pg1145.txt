Statement on the Death of Ted Williams

July 5, 2002

    With the passing of Ted Williams, America lost a baseball legend. 
Whether serving the country in the Armed Forces or excelling on the 
baseball diamond, Ted Williams demonstrated unique talent and love of 
country. He inspired young ballplayers across the Nation for decades, 
and we will always remember his persistence on the field and his courage 
off the field. Ted gave baseball some of its best seasons--and he gave 
his own best seasons to his country. He will be greatly missed.
