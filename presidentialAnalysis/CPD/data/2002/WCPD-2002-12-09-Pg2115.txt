Statement on the Death of George Christian

December 2, 2002

    George Christian was an honorable, decent, and kind man who 
represented the best of public service, and he was devoted to his 
family. He was a statesman of the highest integrity. He also was a great 
Texan, whose wise counsel was sought by generations of leaders. Laura 
joins me in offering our most heartfelt condolences to the Christian 
family. We are grateful for the life he lived and the many positive 
contributions he made to his country and to his State.
