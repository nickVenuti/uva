Statement on the West Coast Ports Agreement

November 24, 2002

    ``I am very pleased that labor and management have reached an 
agreement concerning the West Coast ports. This agreement is good for 
workers, good for employers, and it's good for America's economy. I 
congratulate labor and management for working together to successfully 
resolve their disagreements, and I also commend the efforts of Labor 
Secretary Elaine Chao and the Director of the Federal Mediation and 
Conciliation Service, Peter Hurtgen, for their tireless efforts in 
bringing this matter to a successful conclusion.''
