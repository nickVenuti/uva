Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Karachi, Pakistan

May 8, 2002

    The United States deplores and condemns the terrorist murders 
carried out by a suicide bomber in Karachi, Pakistan, earlier today. 
Today's attack underscores the dangers all our citizens and societies 
continue to face from such attacks and strengthens our resolve to 
continue working together to fight terrorism at home and abroad.
    On behalf of the American people, I extend my condolences to the 
families of the victims and the people of Pakistan and France, whose 
citizens were killed in this attack.
