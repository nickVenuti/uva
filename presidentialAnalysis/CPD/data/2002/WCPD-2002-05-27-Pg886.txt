Statement on Congressional Action on the Proposed ``Public Health 
Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002''

May 23, 2002

    I applaud members of both parties, including Congressman Tauzin and 
Dingell and Senators Kennedy, Gregg, and Frist, for acting on my 
proposals to protect Americans against bioterrorism. This legislation 
strengthens food safety and security, improves the ability of Federal, 
State, and local authorities to coordinate their response to possible 
bioterrorist attacks, and enhances surveillance and security over 
dangerous biological agents.
    I commend the House and Senate for their hard work and look forward 
to signing this important bipartisan legislation into law.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 3448, the proposed ``Public Health 
Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.''
