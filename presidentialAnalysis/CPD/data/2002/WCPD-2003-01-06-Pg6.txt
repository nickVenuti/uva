Message on the Observance of New Year's Day, 2003

December 31, 2002

    The past year has been a time of achievement, progress, and renewed 
hope for the American people. As our citizens continue to demonstrate a 
spirit of resolve and unity, we are building a culture of service, 
citizenship, and responsibility that strengthens our country and offers 
hope to those in need. To counter new threats, we are enhancing security 
at home, and we are part of the global coalition against terrorism that 
has made significant progress in opposing the forces of tyranny and 
oppression.
    We will continue our efforts to secure America, win the war on 
terrorism, focus on education, promote compassion, create new jobs, and 
ensure the economic security of all our citizens. As we move forward 
into the New Year, I encourage all Americans to give thanks to the 
Almighty for His many blessings, and to join with me in reaffirming our 
commitment to helping people around the world achieve peace and freedom.
    At the dawn of this New Year, America is a land of justice, liberty, 
and tolerance. We will work together to build on our successes and 
embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
    Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a Happy New Year. May 
God bless you, and may God continue to bless the United States.
                                                George W. Bush
