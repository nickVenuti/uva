Joint U.S.-Russia Statement on Iraq

November 22, 2002

    We have expressed our serious concern about the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. In this context, we pledge our full support 
for the implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1441. We call 
on Iraq to comply fully and immediately with this and all relevant UN 
Security Council Resolutions, which were adopted as a necessary step to 
secure international peace and security.
    We firmly support the efforts of the United Nations Monitoring, 
Verification and Inspection Commission Chairman and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency Director General to fulfill their responsibilities 
under UN Security Council resolutions.
    We call on Iraq, in strict compliance with UNSC resolution 1441, to 
cooperate fully and unconditionally in its disarmament obligations or 
face serious consequences.
