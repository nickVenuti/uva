Statement on the Earthquake in Iran

June 22, 2002

    I am saddened by the news of the earthquake centered in Iran this 
morning. I extend my condolences and those of the American people to the 
families of the many victims in the cities and villages affected by this 
tragic event. Human suffering knows no political boundaries: We stand 
ready to assist the people of Iran as needed and as desired.
