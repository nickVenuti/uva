Statement on the Death of Princess Margaret of the United Kingdom

February 9, 2002

    Laura and I are deeply saddened to learn of Princess Margaret's 
death. Princess Margaret was a proud mother and grandmother whose 
compassion and support for charities helped better the lives of many in 
need. Our thoughts and prayers are with her children, grandchildren, and 
the entire royal family.
