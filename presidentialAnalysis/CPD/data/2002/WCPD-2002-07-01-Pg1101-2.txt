Statement on House of Representatives Action on Defense Appropriations 
Legislation

June 27, 2002

    I commend the Members of the House for their strong, bipartisan show 
of unity in our war against terrorism with passage of the defense 
appropriations bill. I urge the Senate to work in a similar bipartisan 
fashion and pass the bill in July so that our men and women in the armed 
services have every resource they need to continue defending freedom. It 
is critical in this time of war that the defense appropriations bill be 
at the front, not the end, of the legislative line. Our troops deserve 
nothing less.
