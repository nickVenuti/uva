Area

July 9, 2002

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: 2002 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area

    I am delighted that the Secretary of Agriculture, Ann M. Veneman, 
has agreed to serve as the Chair of the 2002 Combined Federal Campaign 
(CFC) of the National Capital Area. I ask you to enthusiastically 
support the CFC by personally chairing the campaign in your agency and 
appointing a top official as your Vice Chair.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. Public servants not 
only contribute to the campaign but also assume leadership roles to 
ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help positively influence 
thousands of employees and will guarantee another successful campaign.
                                                George W. Bush

Note: This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on July 10.
