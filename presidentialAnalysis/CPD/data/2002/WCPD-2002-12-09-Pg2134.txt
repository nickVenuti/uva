Statement on the Resignations of Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and 
National Economic Council Director Lawrence Lindsey

December 6, 2002

    My economic team has worked with me to craft and implement an 
economic agenda that helped to lead the Nation out of recession and back 
into a period of growth. I appreciate Paul O'Neill's and Larry Lindsey's 
important contributions to making this happen. Both are highly talented 
and dedicated, and they have served my administration and our Nation 
well. I thank them for their excellent service.
