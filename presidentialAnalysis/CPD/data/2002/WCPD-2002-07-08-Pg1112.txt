Statement on Signing the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002

June 28, 2002

    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 327, the ``Small Business 
Paperwork Relief Act of 2002.'' This legislation will help achieve an 
important objective of my Administration to reduce the cost and burden 
on small businesses of government paperwork and increase the resources 
available to small businesses to create jobs and economic growth.
    Section 3 of the bill creates a new section 3520 in title 44 of the 
United States Code to create an interagency task force on information 
collection and dissemination to help the heads of departments and 
agencies reduce the government burden on small businesses. Section 3520 
purports to require task force publication of differences in views among 
executive officers and transmittal of recommendations to congressional 
committees. The executive branch shall construe section 3520 in a manner 
consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise 
the unitary executive branch, to protect the confidentiality of 
executive deliberations, and to recommend to the consideration of the 
Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
 June 28, 2002.
