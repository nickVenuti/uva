Statement on Proposed Pension Security Legislation

February 26, 2002

    I applaud Senators Tim Hutchinson, Trent Lott, and Judd Gregg for 
introducing legislation today to strengthen the retirement security of 
American workers. This legislation would protect workers by giving them 
freedom to manage their own retirement savings, fair notice of any 
blackout period, better access to sound investment advice, and is 
consistent with the retirement security principles I previously 
outlined. This bill also assures

that corporate officers would be held to the same restrictions as those 
imposed on workers.
    I look forward to working with the Congress in a bipartisan fashion 
to enact these important protections into law.

Note: The statement referred to S. 1969, the ``Pension Security Act of 
2002.''
