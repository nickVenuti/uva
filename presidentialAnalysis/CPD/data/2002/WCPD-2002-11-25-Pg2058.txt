Statement on Congressional Action on Legislation To Establish the 
Department of Homeland Security

November 19, 2002

    The United States Congress has taken an historic and bold step 
forward to protect the American people by passing legislation to create 
the Department of Homeland Security. This landmark legislation, the most 
extensive reorganization of the Federal Government since the 1940s, will 
help our Nation meet the emerging threats of terrorism in the 21st 
century.
    This bill includes the major components of my proposal--providing 
for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, strengthening 
our borders, improving the use of science and technology to counter 
weapons of mass destruction, and creating a comprehensive response and 
recovery division.
    I commend the employees who will move into this new Department for 
their hard work and dedication to the war on terrorism. Setting up this 
new Department will take time, but I know we will meet the challenge 
together.
    I look forward to signing this important legislation.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
