Statement on Signing the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002

November 7, 2002

    Earlier today I signed into law H.R. 4685, the Accountability for 
Tax Dollars Act. I was pleased to sign this legislation, and I thank 
Congressman Pat Toomey for his hard work on this bill.
    The American people deserve an efficient Government. Requiring 
agencies to provide accurate financial information helps ensure their 
accountability.

Note: H.R. 4685, approved November 7, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
289.
