Statement on Proposed Pension Security Legislation

February 14, 2002

    I applaud Congressmen John Boehner and Sam Johnson for introducing 
legislation today to strengthen the retirement security of American 
workers. Consistent with the principles that I outlined at the beginning 
of this month, their bill would protect workers by giving them freedom 
to manage their own retirement savings, fair notice of any blackout 
period, and better access to sound investment advice. This bill also 
assures that corporate officers would be held to the same restrictions 
as those imposed on workers.
    This bill, and other good legislation like that introduced by 
Congressmen Portman and Cardin, will help provide economic security to 
both workers and shareholders. I look forward to working with the 
Congress in a bipartisan fashion to enact these important protections 
into law.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 3762, the ``Pension Security Act,'' 
and H.R. 3669, the ``Employee Retirement Savings Bill of Rights.''
