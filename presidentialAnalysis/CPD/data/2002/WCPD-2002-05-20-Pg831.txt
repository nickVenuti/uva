Statement on the Proposed ``Charity Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment Act 
of 2002''

May 15, 2002

    I was pleased to meet this morning with the leadership of the United 
Jewish Communities (UJC). We share a strong commitment to see passage of 
the CARE (``Charity Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment'') Act. The UJC and 
more than 1,600 other organizations--ranging from America's Second 
Harvest to the YMCA--support this important piece of legislation, which 
will spur charitable giving and create a more level playing field for 
faith-based and community organizations.
    America should stand by the charities that support people in need 
and in crisis. Giving to many charities--and particularly to social 
service organizations--is down, while the demands on them remain great. 
The Senate should pass the CARE Act, and the Congress should send me 
legislation that I can sign that will help support the vital work of 
thousands of faith-based and community-based charities across America.
