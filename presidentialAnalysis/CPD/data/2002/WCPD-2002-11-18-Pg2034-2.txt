Statement on Elections in Bahrain

November 14, 2002

    The United States welcomes Bahrain's first parliamentary elections 
in nearly 30 years. Bahrain is a close friend and an important example 
of a nation making the transition to democracy.
    The national elections recently concluded promise to strengthen the 
establishment of representative institutions in Bahrain and to help meet 
the political aspirations of all its citizens, including women who fully 
participated in the electoral process.
    I strongly support the efforts that King Hamad and the people of 
Bahrain have undertaken to uphold democratic principles and the rule of 
law. The United States will continue to support Bahrain as it pursues 
these goals.
