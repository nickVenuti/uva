Statement on the Clear Skies Initiative

July 1, 2002

    Today Environmental Protection Administrator Whitman released 
important new information about the unprecedented health and 
environmental benefits of the Clear Skies Initiative that I proposed in 
February. For the last several months, EPA has been working to generate 
new information about how Clear Skies will dramatically improve air 
quality in every region of the country. Clear Skies will bring Americans 
much cleaner air and healthier forests, lakes, and estuaries. Many 
cities and towns will meet air quality standards for the first time in 
years. We will virtually eliminate the problem of acid rain, which 
affects so many lakes and forests in the Northeast. We also will 
dramatically reduce urban smog and nitrogen and mercury deposition. 
Clear Skies will reduce air pollution from powerplants by 70 percent--
the most significant step America has ever taken

to address this problem--while using a market-based system to keep 
electricity prices affordable for hardworking Americans. Administrator 
Whitman and I look forward to working with Congress to strengthen the 
Clean Air Act through the passage of Clear Skies so we can improve air 
quality for all Americans.
