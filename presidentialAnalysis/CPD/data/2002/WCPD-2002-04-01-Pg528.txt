Message on the Observance of Passover, 5762

March 27, 2002

    I send greetings to all Americans and to all people around the world 
who are observing Passover this week, which begins at sundown on March 
27.
    Passover marks a uniquely special time in the Jewish calendar, 
commemorating Judaism's foremost traditions of freedom, faith, and 
family. In celebrating the Israelites' liberation from enslavement and 
their exodus from Egypt, Passover reminds Jews of their sacred 
tradition. It is a time for Jewish families to share together in long-
established rituals and to offer prayers that celebrate the renewal of 
hope in the blessings of freedom.
    The story of the Exodus speaks across the millennia. By God's power 
and blessing, the children of Abraham overcame Pharaoh's tyranny forty 
centuries ago and found freedom in the promised land. Every year at 
Passover, Jews relive the experience of the Exodus and remember the 
miracles that provided them their path to freedom.
    As we seek peace throughout the world, we are reminded that freedom 
is a precious gift. At this Passover, I hope that people of every faith 
will affirm that freedom is the right of all people. And as Jews observe 
this sacred time, I hope that your faith will be strengthened in the 
remembrance of your miraculous and living heritage.
    Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a blessed Passover.
                                                George W. Bush
