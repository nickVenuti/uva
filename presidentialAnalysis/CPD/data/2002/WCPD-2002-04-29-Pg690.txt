Statement on Senate Action on National Energy Policy Legislation

April 25, 2002

    The Senate today passed legislation that includes many of the 
provisions called for in my administration's national energy policy. 
Together, the House and Senate energy bills include the major 
conservation and environmentally responsible production measures needed 
to reduce our reliance on foreign sources of energy.
    I am pleased that the House-Senate conference committee will have 
before it the elements of a comprehensive energy policy. The two bills 
reflect my administration's call to provide tax incentives for 
alternative and renewable fuels and technology; modernize our 
electricity laws; open a small portion of ANWR to responsible 
exploration; increase automotive fuel efficiency while protecting 
American lives and jobs; and ensure continued safe operation of our 
nuclear facilities.
    It is imperative that America increase its energy independence, and 
I look forward to working with the conferees to ensure that we enact a 
balanced and comprehensive energy policy this year.
