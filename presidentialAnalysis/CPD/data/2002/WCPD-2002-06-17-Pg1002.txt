Statement on Senate Failure To Permanently Repeal the Death Tax

June 12, 2002

    Today's failure by the Senate to permanently repeal the death tax is 
a disappointment to the American people. It is wrong that, as a result 
of a quirk in the law, millions of Americans will be subject to the 
death tax beginning at the end of the decade. The Congress must fix this 
unfair tax and provide families with certainty so they can plan for the 
future.
