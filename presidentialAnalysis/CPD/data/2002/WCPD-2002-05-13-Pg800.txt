Statement on the End of the Standoff at the Church of the Nativity in 
Bethlehem

May 10, 2002

    I am pleased by the nonviolent end to the standoff at the Church of 
the Nativity in Bethlehem. Like the resolution to the situation in 
Ramallah, the positive result in Bethlehem was achieved through the 
efforts of a number of individuals and governments. In particular, I 
appreciate the efforts of personnel at our Embassy in Tel Aviv and our 
Consulate General in Jerusalem, which were critical to the outcome, and 
the work of the European Union.
    The end of the standoff in Bethlehem is a positive development that 
removes an obstacle to restoring security cooperation between the 
parties and should advance the prospects for resuming a political 
process toward peace. As I said on April 4th, this can only happen if 
all parties assume their responsibilities for fighting terror and 
promoting peace.
