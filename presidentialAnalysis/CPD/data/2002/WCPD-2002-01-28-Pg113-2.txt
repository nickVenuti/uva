Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) and as part of my effort to keep the 
Congress fully informed, I am providing a report prepared by my

the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council. The last 
report, consistent with Public Law 102-1, was transmitted on October 11, 
2001.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
