Remarks During a Tour of the Citizens Police Academy in Knoxville, 
Tennessee

April 8, 2002

    Thanks, I'm honored to be here. I'm here to explain to the Nation 
the importance of citizens becoming involved with preparedness in their 
communities. And I want to thank the chief and the mayor, and thank you, 
Captain, for providing an outlet for good citizens who love their 
country, and who generally have asked the question, ``What can I do to 
make my community a better place?''
    The reason we've come to Knoxville is because this is a model 
program. And I want other people to see what is possible. I also want 
them to see the good citizens in action, like yourselves. I want to 
thank you--I'm a grateful President, for a grateful nation, for helping 
your community.

Note: The President spoke at 11:43 a.m. in Training Room A of the 
Knoxville Police Department Training Facility. In his remarks, he 
referred to Mayor Victor H. Ashe of Knoxville; and Chief of Police Phil 
E. Keith and Captain Don Green of the Knoxville Police Department. A 
tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
