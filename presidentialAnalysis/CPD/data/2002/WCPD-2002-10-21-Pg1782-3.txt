Statement on Congressional Action on Defense Appropriations Legislation

October 16, 2002

    I commend the House and Senate for responding to my call to pass the 
defense appropriations bill. This defense budget will provide our troops 
with the best pay, the best equipment, and the best possible training. 
It also sends an important signal that we are committed to defending 
freedom and defeating terror. The Congress acted responsibly in passing 
the defense appropriations bill first, and I look forward to signing it.
