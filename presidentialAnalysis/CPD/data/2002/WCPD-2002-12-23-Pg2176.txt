Statement on the Peace Agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

December 18, 2002

    I welcome the signing of the peace agreement that brings an end to 4 
years of civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I appreciate 
the strong leadership and commitment of President Kabila to form a 
transitional government in Congo. I further commend all parties on their 
willingness to make the tough decisions to ensure a peaceful and 
democratic future for the Congolese people.
    This peace agreement offers the Congolese people a critical 
opportunity to build lasting peace in a unified Congo. The United States 
will continue to work with Congo's Government, the Congolese Liberation 
Movement, and the Congolese Rally for Democracy and Civil Society to 
move forward on implementing the agreement, which will result in 
national elections.
    I thank President Mbeki for his leadership and efforts on behalf of 
peace in the Congo and throughout Africa. The United States looks 
forward to working with the African Union and the United Nations to help 
the Congolese people realize their dream for national reconciliation and 
growing prosperity.

Note: The statement referred to President Joseph Kabila of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and President Thabo Mbeki of South 
Africa.
