Joint Statement Between the United States of America and Israel

October 16, 2002

    As part of the effort to further Palestinian reform, the President 
of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel agreed that the 
Government of Israel would consider favorably the gradual return and 
scheduled transfer of all PA tax funds collected by Israel on the 
unequivocal condition that there would be full U.S.-led monitoring to 
ensure that these funds will only be used for the economic and civil 
activities of the Palestinian community and to prevent the use of these 
funds for terrorist activity of any kind.
