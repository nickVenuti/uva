States Fisheries Agreement

February 4, 2002

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an 
Agreement between the United States of America and the Government of the 
People's Republic of China extending the Agreement of June 24, 1985, 
Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, with annex, as 
extended (the ``1985 Agreement''). The present Agreement, which was 
effected by an exchange of notes in Beijing on April 6 and July 17, 
2001, extends the 1985 Agreement to July 1, 2004.

    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
People's Republic of China, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement.
