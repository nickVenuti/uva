    I congratulate Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Director of 
the Office of Management and Budget Alice Rivlin, and

former Secretary of State George Shultz on their receipt of the first 
Elliot Richardson Prize for excellence and integrity in public service, 
awarded by the Council for Excellence in Government. Each of these 
distinguished public servants possesses the virtues embodied by Elliot 
Richardson: enduring commitment to the greater public good; a lifetime 
of public service; and courage, integrity, and diligence in the pursuit 
of excellence in Government.
    Since September 11, Americans have demonstrated a renewed 
appreciation for the sacrifices that public servants make and for the 
commitment they bring to their jobs. The examples set by Secretary 
Powell, Director Rivlin, and Secretary Shultz stand as an inspiration to 
all Americans including our young people, especially those considering a 
career in Government service. Their lives serve as a testimony that 
public service is a noble calling.
