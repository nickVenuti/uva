Statement on the Terrorist Attack in the Russian Federation's Republic 
of Dagestan

May 9, 2002

    The United States is saddened and angered by the deaths earlier 
today in an explosion during Victory Day celebrations in the town of 
Kaspiysk in the Russian Federation's Republic of Dagestan. Of particular 
concern is that this evil act of terrorism occurred on a holiday when 
Russia celebrates its World War II victory over fascism and at a time 
when our nations are allied once again in a war against global terror. 
Terrorism and the killing of innocents can never be condoned or 
justified.
    On behalf of the American people, I extend my condolences to the 
families of the innocent children, veterans, and others killed, and I 
wish a full and fast recovery for those wounded in the incident.
