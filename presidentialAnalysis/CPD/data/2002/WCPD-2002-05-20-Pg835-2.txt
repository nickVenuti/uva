Statement on Completion of the NATO Mission in the United States

May 16, 2002

    I thank NATO for the steadfast support and cooperation after the 
attacks on September 11. Today marks the end of NATO aircraft and crews 
patrolling American skies as part of Operation Noble Eagle. These 
aircrews began their deployment soon after the terrorist attacks of 
September 11th. This deployment, coupled with the declaration that the 
attacks on the United States were attacks on all NATO members, affirmed 
NATO's commitment to collective defense.
    For 220 days, NATO aircrews from 12 nations, based at Tinker AFB in 
Oklahoma, flew missions over the United States. On behalf of the 
American people, I thank them

for their important contribution to the defense of this Nation.
