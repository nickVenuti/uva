Situation in the Middle East

    Let me say one thing before I leave. First of all, I meant what I 
said to the Prime Minister of Israel. I expect there to be withdrawal 
without delay. And I also meant what I said to the Arab world, that in 
order for there to be peace, nations must stand up, leaders must stand 
up and condemn terrorism, terrorist activity.
    There is a mutual responsibility to achieve peace, and it's going to 
require leadership on both sides. And the United States is firmly 
committed to achieving peace and is firmly committed--I am firmly 
committed to what I expect from both parties.
    I repeat, I meant what I said about withdrawal without delay, and I 
mean what I say when I call upon the Arab world to strongly condemn and 
act against terrorist activity.

Note: The President spoke at 12:06 p.m. at the Knoxville Police 
Department Training Facility. In his remarks, he referred to Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel.
