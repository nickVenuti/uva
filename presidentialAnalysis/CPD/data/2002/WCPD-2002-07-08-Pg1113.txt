Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Temporary Transfer of the Powers 
and Duties of President of the United States

June 29, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    As my staff has previously communicated to you, I will undergo this 
morning a routine medical procedure requiring sedation. In view of 
present circumstances, I have determined to transfer temporarily my 
Constitutional powers and duties to the Vice President during the brief 
period of the procedure and recovery.
    Accordingly, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the 
Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, this letter 
shall constitute my written declaration that I am unable to discharge 
the Constitutional powers and duties of the office of President of the 
United States. Pursuant to Section 3, the Vice President shall discharge 
those powers and duties as Acting President until I transmit to you a 
written declaration that I am able to resume the discharge of those 
powers and duties.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, and Robert C. Byrd, President pro tempore of the 
Senate. The Office of the Press Secretary released the text of both
