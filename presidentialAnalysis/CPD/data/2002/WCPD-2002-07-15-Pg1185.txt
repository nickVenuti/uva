Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Fiscal Year 2003 Budget Amendments

July 12, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for FY 2003 
budget amendments for the Securities and Exchange Commission and for the 
Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Housing and Urban Development. 
The discretionary budgetary resources proposed in my FY 2003 budget 
would not be increased by these requests.
    This transmittal also contains FY 2003 budget amendments for the 
legislative branch. As a matter of comity, appropriations requests of 
the legislative branch are transmitted without change. These additional 
amendments would increase discretionary resources for the legislative 
branch by $17.7 million.
    The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
his comments and observations.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
