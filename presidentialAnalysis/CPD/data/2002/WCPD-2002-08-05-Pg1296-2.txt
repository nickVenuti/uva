Statement on Senate Action on Defense Appropriations Legislation

August 1, 2002

Defense appropriations bill. With our Nation at war, it is imperative 
that we address the important priority of ensuring that our troops have 
the resources they need. I urge the House and Senate to resolve their 
differences promptly and send a bill to my desk in early September.
