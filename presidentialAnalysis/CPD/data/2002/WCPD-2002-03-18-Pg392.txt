Remarks on the Unveiling of the September 11th United States Postage 
Stamp

March 11, 2002

    The President. Welcome. We're about to unveil a stamp. It's an 
extraordinary piece of work. I want to thank the photographer here, and 
I want to thank Gary Ackerman for sponsoring it. This stamp will sell 
for 45 cents; 11 cents, obviously, more than the current price of a 
stamp. Eight cents will go to a victims' fund to help those family 
members who are struggling in the aftermath of 9/11. It is a--it's a 
good gesture by the Postal Service. The Postmaster General is here, and 
I want to thank you for that very much.
    Postmaster General Potter. Thank you, Mr. President.
    The President. The three officers are here, and they're on the 
stamp. And I appreciate you all allowing your--allowing the Postal 
Service to use you as a way to help our Nation remember the terrible 
incident that took place 6 months ago and help people get their lives 
back in order.
    And so it's with pleasure that we reveal the stamp.

[At this point, the stamp was unveiled.]

    The President. Fabulous, good job, really good job.

Note: The President spoke at 2:50 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks,
