Statement on House of Representatives Action on Pension Reform 
Legislation

April 11, 2002

    Employees need more information about their pension plans and more 
control over them. I commend Chairman Thomas, Chairman Boehner, and 
Congressman Portman, and the bipartisan majority in the House for 
passing pension reform legislation that accomplishes these objectives. 
The reforms will give employees better access to investment advice, 
additional notice of blackouts, and increased ability to diversify. 
Importantly, the reforms adhere to the principle that what is right for 
executives is also right for workers. I look forward to Senate action on 
this critical issue.
