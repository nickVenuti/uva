Statement on Senate Action To Extend the Debt Limit

June 11, 2002

    I commend the Senate for passing an extension of the debt limit. We 
must ensure that we have the resources to wage the war against terror, 
to protect retirees, and to meet our Government's other obligations. 
Today's strong bipartisan vote is important progress toward achieving 
this goal.
