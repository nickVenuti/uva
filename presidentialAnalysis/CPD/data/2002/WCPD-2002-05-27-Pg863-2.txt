Statement on the Establishment of East Timor

May 21, 2002

    The United States salutes the establishment of East Timor, the first 
new nation of the millennium. With those in Dili, we celebrate the 
successful conclusion of the long struggle of the people of East Timor 
for an independent nation. We are heartened that the people of East 
Timor have embraced the path of democracy that will lead their nation to 
peace and prosperity. On behalf of the American people, I congratulate 
Xanana Gusmao, who was sworn in as East Timor's first President.
    The United Nations has played a pivotal role in bringing East Timor 
into the family of nations. We praise the contributions and efforts of 
the international community which helped make the United Nations 
Transitional Administration in East Timor a success.
