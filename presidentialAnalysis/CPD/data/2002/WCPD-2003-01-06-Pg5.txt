Statement Calling for Congressional Action on a Pay Increase for the 
Federal Judiciary

December 31, 2002

    Today I have issued an Executive order entitled ``Adjustments of 
Certain Rates of Pay.'' This order implements the January 2003 pay raise 
for members of the uniformed services and for Federal civilian employees 
under the General Schedule and certain related pay systems.
    This Executive order sets forth the unadjusted pay schedule for 
members of the Federal judiciary. Due to section 140 of Public Law 97-
92, I do not have the authority to order a pay increase for Federal 
judges. I hereby urge the Congress to specifically authorize a pay 
increase for Federal judges.
