Statement on Senate Action on the Proposed ``Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
2002''

July 25, 2002

    Today's passage by Congress of corporate accounting reforms is a 
victory for America's shareholders and employees. House and Senate 
passage of this legislation demonstrates what can happen when leaders 
work together to solve problems. I look forward to signing these 
important reforms into law. In February I also proposed tough changes to 
reform employee pension programs, and the House quickly responded. I 
urge the Senate to act before they recess to protect the savings of 
America's workers.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 3763, the proposed ``Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002.''
