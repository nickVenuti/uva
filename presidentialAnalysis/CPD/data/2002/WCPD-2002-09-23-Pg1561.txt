Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments

September 13, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for FY 2003 
budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Interior, 
and Transportation; International Assistance Programs; and the National 
Capital Planning Commission.
    In total, these amendments would not affect the budgetary resources 
proposed in my FY 2003 Budget.
    The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
his comments and observations.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
