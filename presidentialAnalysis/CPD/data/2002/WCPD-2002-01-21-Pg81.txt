Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902 of the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-
246) (the ``Act''), and as President of the United States, I hereby 
report to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United 
States to terminate the suspensions under section 902 of the Act insofar 
as such suspensions pertain to the export of bomb containment and 
disposal units for use in the prevention of terrorist bombings.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
