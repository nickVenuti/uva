Statement on House of Representatives Action on Welfare Reform 
Legislation

May 16, 2002

    Today the House passed welfare reform legislation that will help 
millions of Americans realize a life of hope, dignity, and independence. 
This compassionate approach builds upon our past successes by moving 
more Americans from welfare to work, encouraging strong families and 
healthy marriages, and freeing States to innovate as they help people 
find the independence of a job.
    I commend the House for moving quickly and now urge the Senate to 
act on behalf of those who seek a better life.
