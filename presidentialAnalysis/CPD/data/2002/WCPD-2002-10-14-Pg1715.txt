Statement on the Sniper Attacks in the Greater Washington Area

October 7, 2002

    In recent days we have witnessed a series of cowardly and senseless 
acts of violence in the greater Washington area. I have committed 
Federal resources to support the local law enforcement agencies that are 
in charge of the investigation, including FBI profiling experts and 
ballistics analysts from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
    I have also directed the Departments of Education and Health and 
Human Services to assist the students, teachers, and families affected 
by the violence by providing counseling and other community health 
services.
    I applaud the State and local law enforcement officials who are 
working around the clock to help solve these heinous crimes and protect 
our citizens. Laura and I send our thoughts and prayers to the victims 
and their families.
