Statement on Senate Passage of Campaign Finance Reform Legislation

March 20, 2002

    Like many Republicans and Democrats in the Congress, I support 
commonsense reforms to end abuses in our campaign finance system. The 
reforms passed today, while flawed in some areas, still improve the 
current system overall, and I will sign them into law.

    The legislation makes some important progress on the timeliness of 
disclosure, individual contribution limits, and banning soft money from 
corporations and labor unions, but it does present some legitimate 
constitutional questions. I continue to believe the best reform is full 
and timely disclosure of campaign contributions.
