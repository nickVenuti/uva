Statement on Terrorist Attacks in Israel and Kenya

November 28, 2002

    I condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the terrorist attacks 
today at the Likud Party polling place in northern Israel and the 
Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, Kenya, as well as the attempted attack on a 
civilian airliner shortly after it took off from Mombasa's international 
airport. I want to extend my condolences to the victims and their 
families, and to the governments and peoples of Israel and Kenya. 
Today's attacks underscore the continuing willingness of those opposed 
to peace to commit horrible crimes. Those who seek peace must do 
everything in their power to dismantle the infrastructure of terror that 
makes such actions possible. The United States remains firmly committed, 
with its partners around the world, to the fight against terror and 
those who commit these heinous acts.
                                                George W. Bush
