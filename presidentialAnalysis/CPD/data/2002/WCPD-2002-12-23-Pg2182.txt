Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa

December 20, 2002

    I send greetings to those celebrating Kwanzaa.
    Kwanzaa celebrates the traditional African values of unity, self-
determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative 
economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. From December 26th to January 
1st, people of African descent gather to renew their commitment to these 
seven principles, known as Nguzo Saba, and give thanks for the blessings 
of family, community, and culture. Kwanzaa is also a time for Africans 
and African-Americans to honor their common heritage by participating in 
events based on early harvest gatherings called matunda ya kwanza, or 
first fruits.
    As individuals and families join together during Kwanzaa, their joy 
enriches communities in the United States and across the globe. By 
uniting people of diverse backgrounds and beliefs, this holiday promotes 
mutual understanding and respect. These universal principles inspire us 
as we work together for a future of freedom, hope, and opportunity for 
all.
    Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a memorable Kwanzaa, 
and for peace, happiness, and success in the coming year.
                                                George W. Bush
