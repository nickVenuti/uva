Videotape Remarks for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade

 November 28, 2002

    Good morning. As we gather to celebrate Thanksgiving, let us 
remember to share our blessings and make this holiday season a time for 
giving to those in need. By helping a neighbor, we serve our Nation, and 
we serve a cause greater than self-interest. Everyone can do something. 
And through the USA Freedom Corps, you can find ways to help at a 
school, a food pantry, or any other organization near you.
    Macy's and NBC join me in wishing you a happy Thanksgiving, and we 
ask you to make this holiday the start of a season of service.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President's remarks were videotaped at 3:10 p.m. on November 
12 in the Map Room at the White House for broadcast during the telecast 
of the November 28 parade. The transcript was released by the Office of 
the Press Secretary on November 26.
