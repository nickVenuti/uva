Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Department of Defense Budget Amendment

May 29, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:

    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed request for an FY 2003 
budget amendment for the Department of Defense reflecting my decision to 
cancel the Army's Crusader artillery system. The budget totals proposed 
in my FY 2003 Budget would not be affected by this amendment.
    The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
his comments and observations.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on
