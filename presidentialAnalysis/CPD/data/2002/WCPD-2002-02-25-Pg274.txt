Message on the Observance of Eid al-Adha, 2002

February 21, 2002

    I am pleased to send warm greetings to Muslims across the United 
States as you celebrate the Eid al-Adha holiday.
    As you join in spirit with those gathered in Mecca to observe the 
traditions of one of your most sacred feasts, may you share joyful and 
reverent fellowship with family and friends.
    During this special time, our Nation is reminded of the remarkable 
contributions of American Muslims to our history, culture, and way of 
life. Our spiritual foundation and common heritage will continue to 
guide us as we strive to strengthen our country and advance peace and 
goodness in our world.
    Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a joyous observance.
                                                George W. Bush
