Exchange With Reporters at the White House Fitness Expo

June 20, 2002

President's Workout

    Q. Have you worked out today, sir?
    The President. This afternoon. As you know, I'm giving a speech 
tonight, the Sullivan speech. So after working all day long, before the 
speech, I'll work out. I'm going to lift weights. I'm going to do a 
little elliptical training. I'm going to do some physical fitness 
stuff--not an outdoor run today.

Upcoming Speech on the Middle East

    Q. How's the other speech coming?
    The President. The speech I'm giving tonight?
    Q. No, the other one.
    The President. I'll give it at the appropriate time. Thank you all.

Note: The exchange began at 8:33 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this
