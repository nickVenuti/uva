Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus

February 25, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I am 
providing a report prepared by my Administration on progress toward a 
negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering the period December 
1, 2001, through January 31, 2002. The previous submission covered 
October 1 through November 30, 2001.
    On January 16, Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish 
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash began direct talks on the island under the 
auspices of the United Nations. As in past reporting periods, Special 
Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. Weston and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald 
K. Bandler continued to provide diplomatic support to the process. The 
United States remains committed to the United Nations effort to find a 
just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Joseph R. Biden, Jr., chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations.
