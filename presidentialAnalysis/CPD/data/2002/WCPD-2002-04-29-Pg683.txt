Statement on House of Representatives Action on Corporate Responsibility 
Legislation

April 24, 2002

    I commend the House for acting quickly to pass reforms that improve 
corporate responsibility and protect shareholders. The House bill 
includes the three core principles of my 10-point plan--providing better 
information to investors, making corporate officers more accountable, 
and developing a stronger, more independent audit system. With 80 
million Americans participating as shareholders of companies, we must 
ensure high standards, tough disclosure requirements, and accurate 
information. The House bill is a responsible approach to addressing 
these important issues.
