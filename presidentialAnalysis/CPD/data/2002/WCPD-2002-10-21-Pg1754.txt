Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Indonesia

October 13, 2002

    Terrorists have once again targeted innocents this time in 
Indonesia. At least 182 innocent men and women have been murdered and 
hundreds injured in a cowardly act designed to create terror and chaos.
    On behalf of the people of the United States, I condemn this heinous 
act. I offer our heartfelt condolences to the families of all the murder 
victims from numerous countries and our wish for the swift and complete 
recovery of those injured in this attack.
    I offer our sympathy to our friends, the people of Indonesia, for 
this terrible tragedy. Our prayers are also with our friends and allies, 
the people of Australia, who are suffering a grievous personal and 
national loss.
    The world must confront this global menace terrorism. We must 
together challenge and defeat the idea that the wanton killing of 
innocents advances any cause or supports any aspirations. And we must 
call this despicable act by its rightful name murder.
    The United States has offered its assistance to the government of 
Indonesia to help bring these murderers to justice.
                                                George W. Bush
