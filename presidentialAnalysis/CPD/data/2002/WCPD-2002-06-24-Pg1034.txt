Statement on Senate Action on Terrorism Insurance Legislation

June 18, 2002

    Terrorism insurance is critical to promoting and protecting jobs and 
America's economic security. I am pleased that the Senate has now passed 
a bill that will help give businesses access to reasonable terrorism 
insurance. The final terrorism insurance package must include reasonable 
litigation procedures so that Americans who are victimized by terrorism 
do not also fall victim to predatory lawsuits and punitive damages. I 
look forward to working with the House and Senate conferees so that I 
can sign responsible terrorism insurance legislation into law.
