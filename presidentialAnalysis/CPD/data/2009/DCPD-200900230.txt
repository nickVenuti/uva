Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain in Prague, Czech Republic April 5, 2009 I just want to say that I've very much enjoyed working with Mr. Zapatero over the last several days. He is somebody who clearly understands not only Spain's extraordinary influence in the world, but also takes those responsibilities very seriously. And I think that we're going to be able to establish what is already a strong relationship between the two countries. I think we can make it even stronger. So I'm glad to call him a friend, and I welcome our opportunities to cooperate on a whole host of issues in the years to come. NOTE: The President spoke at 3:11 p.m. in the Prague Congress Center.
