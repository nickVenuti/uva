Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on Senate Action on Energy Reform Legislation September 30, 2009 I applaud Chairmen Kerry and Boxer for their leadership on comprehensive energy reform. With the draft legislation they are announcing today, we are one step closer to putting America in control of our energy future and making America more energy independent. My administration is deeply committed to passing a bill that creates new American jobs and the clean energy incentives that foster innovation.
