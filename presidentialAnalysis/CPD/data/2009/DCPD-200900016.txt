Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on the Appointment of Kirsten Gillibrand as Senator for New York January 23, 2009 Governor Paterson made a wonderful choice in appointing Kirsten Gillibrand to fill Secretary Clinton's seat in the United States Senate. I am confident that she will continue Secretary Clinton's distinguished service to the people of New York and to our country. During her career, Kirsten has been a strong voice for transparency and reform in government and shares the belief that government should be open, accessible and work for all of our citizens.  In Congress and as special counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, she worked to strengthen public and private partnerships to invest in infrastructure and New York's economy. At this time of great challenge, I know that Kirsten has the integrity, character, and dedication to public service to help us achieve our greatest goals. NOTE: The statement referred to Gov. David A. Paterson of New York; and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Categories: Statements by the President : Gillibrand, Kirsten, appointment as U.S. Senator for New York.
