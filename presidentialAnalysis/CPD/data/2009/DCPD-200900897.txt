Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Health Care Reform Legislation November 7, 2009 Tonight, in an historic vote, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would finally make real the promise of quality, affordable health care for the American people. The Affordable Health Care for America Act is a piece of legislation that will provide stability and security for Americans who have insurance, quality affordable options for those who don't, and bring down the cost of health care for families, businesses, and the Government while strengthening the financial health of Medicare. And it is legislation that is fully paid for and will reduce our long-term Federal deficit. Thanks to the hard work of the House, we are just two steps away from achieving health insurance reform in America. Now the United States Senate must follow suit and pass its version of the legislation. I am absolutely confident it will, and I look forward to signing comprehensive health insurance reform into law by the end of the year.
