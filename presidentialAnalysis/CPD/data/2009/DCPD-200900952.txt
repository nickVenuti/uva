Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on Albanian Independence Day November 25, 2009 I send my warmest wishes to all those who will celebrate Albanian Independence Day on Saturday. Here in America, those that can trace their roots to Albania are an important part of this Nation. Abroad, I hope for continued friendship and strengthened ties between our two countries.
