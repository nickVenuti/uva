Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Leaders of the Central American Integration System in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago  April 19, 2009 Well, good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to meet with the leaders of Central America. Obviously, we have a long history of relations between the United States and Central America, that is a critical partner on a whole range of issues. We have the leadership here—democratically elected—and provided a lot of important information during the course of this summit. But obviously, when you're in a group of 36, it's more difficult to focus just on the regional issues. So this gives me an opportunity to hear more directly about both challenges and opportunities in the region. So I'm very grateful that they've taken the time to meet with me, and I'm looking forward to hearing more about how the United States can be an effective partner with all the countries represented. Thank you. NOTE: The President spoke at 8:18 a.m. at the Hyatt Regency Trinidad. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
