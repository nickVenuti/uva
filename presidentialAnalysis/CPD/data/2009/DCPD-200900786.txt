Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on Storm and Flood Damage in the Philippines October 6, 2009  On behalf of the American people, I want to express my deep condolences for the loss of life and devastation caused by recent storms in the Philippines, particularly Tropical Storm Ketsana. Michelle and I feel great sorrow over the hundreds of people who have died from the storms and resulting flooding and the hundreds of thousands more who have been displaced. In the spirit of our long history of friendship and cooperation with the Philippines, the United States has been assisting the people of the Philippines. Our military forces and civilian agencies have supported local Philippine efforts by distributing relief supplies and helped in rescuing victims from inundated areas of Manila. As part of this effort, the U.S. Agency for International Development has so far allocated $1.8 million to respond to the disaster. As a longstanding friend and partner of the Philippines, we stand ready to continue our cooperation and assistance in the coming days.
