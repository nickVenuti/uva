Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on the Election of Matthew S. "Scott" Murphy to the United States House of Representatives April 24, 2009 I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Congressman-elect Scott Murphy for his victory in New York's 20th Congressional District. With this hard-fought win, Scott has shown he is willing to fight the tough battles on behalf of the people in his district. As a candidate, Scott courageously championed the economic plans we need to lift our Nation and put it on a better path, and he will continue to do so in Congress. With his proven record of creating high-paying jobs and standing up for upstate New York, Scott will bring to the Nation’s Capitol the change New Yorkers need.
