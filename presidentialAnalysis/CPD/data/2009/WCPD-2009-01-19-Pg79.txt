Message to the Senate Transmitting the Malta-United States Taxation 
Convention

January 15, 2009

To the Senate of the United States:

    I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, 
the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of Malta for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the 
Prevention of Fiscal Evasion With Respect to Taxes on Income, signed on 
August 8, 2008, at Valletta (the ``proposed Convention''). I also 
transmit for the information of the Senate the report of the Department 
of State, which includes an Overview of the proposed Convention.
    The proposed Convention provides for reduced withholding rates on 
cross-border payments of dividends, interest, royalties, and other 
income. The proposed Convention contains a restrictive provision 
designed to prevent ``treaty shopping,'' which is the inappropriate use 
of a tax treaty by third-country residents. The proposed Convention also 
provides for the exchange of information between the competent 
authorities to facilitate the administration of each country's tax laws.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the proposed Convention and give its advice and consent to 
ratification.
                                                George W. Bush
 The White House,
