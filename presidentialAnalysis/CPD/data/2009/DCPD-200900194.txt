Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on the 30th Anniversary of the Peace Treaty Between Egypt and Israel March 26, 2009 Today marks the anniversary of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, signed 30 years ago at the White House.  As we commemorate this historic event, we recall that peace is always possible even in the face of seemingly intractable conflicts. The success of Prime Minister Begin, President Sadat, and President Carter, begun at Camp David, demonstrated that progress results from sustained efforts at communication and cooperation. While much work remains, we honor the courage and foresight of these leaders, who stood together in unity to change the course of our shared history.  Today, as we seek to expand the circle of peace among Arabs and Israelis, we take inspiration from what Israel and Egypt achieved three decades ago, knowing that the destination is worthy of the struggle.
