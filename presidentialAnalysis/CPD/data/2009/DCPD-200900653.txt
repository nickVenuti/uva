Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on the Death of Former President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea August 18, 2009 I was saddened at the passing of former President Kim Dae-jung of the Republic of Korea, a courageous champion of democracy and human rights. President Kim risked his life to build and lead a political movement that played a crucial role in establishing a dynamic democratic system in the Republic of Korea. His service to his country, his tireless efforts to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula, and his personal sacrifices on behalf of freedom are inspirational and should never be forgotten. On behalf of the American people, I extend my condolences to his family and to the Korean people. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Kim Dae-jung. Names: Kim Dae-jung.
