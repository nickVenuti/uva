Remarks During a Meeting With Former Presidents and the Incoming 
President

January 7, 2009

    I want to thank the President-elect for joining the ex-Presidents 
for lunch. I am--one message that I have, and I think we all share, is 
that we want you to succeed. Whether we're a Democrat or Republican, we 
care deeply about this country. And to the extent we can, we look 
forward to sharing our experiences with you. All of us who have served 
in this office itself understand that the office transcends the 
individual. And we wish you all the very best, and so does the country.

Note: The President spoke at 12 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. Participating in the meeting were former Presidents Jimmy Carter, 
George H.W. Bush, and William J. Clinton; and President-elect Barack 
Obama. The transcipt released by the Office of the Press Secretary also 
included the remarks of President-elect Obama. The Office of the Press 
Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of these remarks.
