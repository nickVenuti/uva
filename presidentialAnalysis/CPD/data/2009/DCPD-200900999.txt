Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Jobs Creation Legislation December 16, 2009 All over our country this holiday season, Americans who lost their jobs in the great recession are looking for work. Today the House answered with some productive ideas to respond to this great need, offering new initiatives including repairing our roads and bridges, providing relief to Americans who have lost their jobs, and preventing layoffs at the State and local level. They complement the proposals I made last week to buttress small businesses with new tax cuts and increased lending and provide incentives to consumers who retrofit their homes. Some may think standing by and taking no action is the right approach, but for the millions of Americans still out of work, inaction is unacceptable.
