Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on Health Care Reform July 7, 2009 I am pleased by the progress we're making on health care reform and still believe, as I've said before, that one of the best ways to bring down costs, provide more choices, and assure quality is a public option that will force the insurance companies to compete and keep them honest. I look forward to a final product that achieves these very important goals. Categories: Statements by the President : Health care reform.
