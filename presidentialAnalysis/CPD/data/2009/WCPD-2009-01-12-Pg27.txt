Statement on the Death of Father Richard John Neuhaus

January 8, 2009

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Father Richard John 
Neuhaus. Father Neuhaus was an inspirational leader, admired theologian, 
and accomplished author who devoted his life to the service of the 
Almighty and to the betterment of our world. He was also a dear friend, 
and I have treasured his wise counsel and guidance.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with Father Neuhaus's family, friends, 
and fellow clergy during this difficult time.
