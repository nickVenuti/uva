Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Exchange With Reporters in Prague, Czech Republic April 5, 2009 The President. Hello, everybody. I hope you're not tired of me by now. Q. Sir, what's your message for North Korea, please? Situation in North Korea The President. We delivered it today. They, I think, have taken a provocative action. It creates instability in their region, around the world. If they want to take an appropriate path to rejoin the international community and break out of their isolation, that's available to them. That's not the path they're taking right now. And we intend to work with the international community to deliver a strong message.
