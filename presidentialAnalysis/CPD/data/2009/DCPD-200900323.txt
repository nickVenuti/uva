Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on the Death of Former Representative Jack F. Kemp May 3, 2009 Jack Kemp's commitment to public service and his passion for politics influenced not only the direction of his party, but his country. From his tenure as a Buffalo Congressman to his ascent in national politics, Jack Kemp was a man who could fiercely advocate his own beliefs and principles while also remembering the lessons he learned years earlier on the football field: that bitter divisiveness between race and class and station only stood in the way of the common aim of a team to win. Michelle and I extend our prayers and deepest condolences to the entire Kemp family. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Kemp, former Rep. Jack F.
