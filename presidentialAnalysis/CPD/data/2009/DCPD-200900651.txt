Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Nazran, Ingushetiya, Russia August 17, 2009 I am deeply troubled about reports of a suicide bombing today in Nazran, Ingushetiya, that has resulted in the tragic loss of at least 20 lives and 138 injured. There can be no justification for such an act of terrorism. This latest attack highlights the concerning increase in violence in the region affecting officials and civilians alike. Our condolences go out to the Government of Russia and the families of victims. Categories: Statements by the President : Russia :: Terrorist attack in Nazran, Ingushetiya.
