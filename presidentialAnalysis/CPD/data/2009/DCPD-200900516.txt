Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on the Situation in Honduras June 28, 2009 I am deeply concerned by reports coming out of Honduras regarding the detention and expulsion of President Mel Zelaya. As the Organization of American States did on Friday, I call on all political and social actors in Honduras to respect democratic norms, the rule of law, and the tenets of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Any existing tensions and disputes must be resolved peacefully through dialog free from any outside interference. Categories: Statements by the President : Honduras situation.
