Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on the Appointment of Paul G. Kirk, Jr., as a United States Senator for Massachusetts September 24, 2009 I am pleased that Massachusetts will have its full representation in the United States Senate in the coming months as important issues such as health care, financial reform, and energy will be debated. Paul Kirk is a distinguished leader, whose long collaboration with Senator Kennedy makes him an excellent interim choice to carry on his work until the voters make their choice in January.
