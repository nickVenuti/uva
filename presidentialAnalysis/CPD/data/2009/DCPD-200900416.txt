Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on the Death of George R. Tiller May 31, 2009 I am shocked and outraged by the murder of Dr. George Tiller as he attended church services this morning. However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence.
