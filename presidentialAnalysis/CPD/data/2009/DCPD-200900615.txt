Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation to Fund the CAR Allowance Rebate System  July 31, 2009 I want to thank leaders in the House of Representatives for working quickly and in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that will use Recovery Act funds to keep "Cash for Clunkers" going. This program has been an overwhelming success, allowing consumers to trade in their less fuel-efficient cars for a credit to buy more fuel-efficient new models. It has given consumers a much needed break, provided the American auto industry an important boost, and is achieving environmental benefits well beyond what was originally anticipated. The program has proven to be a successful part of our economic recovery and will help lessen our dangerous dependence on foreign oil, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the quality of the air we breathe. I urge the Senate to act with the American consumers in mind to pass this important legislation.
