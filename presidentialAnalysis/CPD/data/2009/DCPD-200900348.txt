Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Statement on the Shootings at Camp Victory in Baghdad, Iraq May 11, 2009 I was shocked and deeply saddened to hear the news from Camp Victory this morning, and my heart goes out to the families and friends of all the service members involved in this horrible tragedy. I will press to ensure that we fully understand what led to this tragedy, and that we are doing everything we can to ensure that our men and women in uniform are protected as they serve our country so capably and courageously in harm's way. To begin this process, I met with Secretary Gates this afternoon to get a briefing on the situation. Categories: Statements by the President : Iraq :: Shootings at Camp Victory in Baghdad.
