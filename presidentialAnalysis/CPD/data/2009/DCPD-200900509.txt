Administration of Barack H. Obama, 2009 Remarks at the Congressional Luau June 25, 2009 Aloha. It is wonderful to see you all. I am not going to make a long speech. I just want to say to all the Members of Congress, you've been working hard. I wish I could give you all trips to Hawaii, but I figured since—given our budget crunch we can't do that, that we'd at least bring Hawaii to you.  And I want to thank our wonderful entertainers, Tihati. Thank you very much. I want to thank all the chefs who prepared the outstanding food, especially Alan Wong, a friend from Hawaii, does a great job. I want to—in case you don't know, this is Malia Obama, Sasha Obama, Michelle Obama, and the star of the family, Bo Obama. I hope you guys have a wonderful time. Enjoy. Feel free to just roam around here. And thank you again, Members of Congress, for the unbelievable work that you're doing for the American people each and every day. I appreciate you. Thank you, guys.  NOTE: The President spoke at 7:05 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to entertainers Tihati; and chef Alan Wong. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included remarks by Vice President Joe Biden.  Categories: Addresses and Remarks : Congressional luau. Locations: Washington, DC.
