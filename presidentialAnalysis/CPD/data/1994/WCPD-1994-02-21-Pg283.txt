Statement on the Executive Order on Environmental Justice

February 11, 1994

    All Americans have a right to be protected from pollution--not just 
those who can afford to live in the cleanest, safest communities. Today, 
we direct Federal agencies to make environmental justice a part of all 
that they do.

Note: This statement was part of a White House press release announcing
