Statement on Technology Reinvestment Awards

February 23, 1994

    This marks another major step in our effort to protect our national 
security and promote our economic security in the post-cold-war world. 
We are investing in projects that will create the jobs of the future by 
exploring ideas, developing technologies, creating products, and 
strengthening skills that will keep America strong, militarily and 
economically.

Note: This statement was part of a White House press release announcing 
the fourth round of technology reinvestment awards.
