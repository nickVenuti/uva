Statement on Signing the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living 
Adjustment Act of 1994

October 25, 1994

    Today, I have signed into law S. 1927, the ``Veterans' Compensation 
Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1994.''
    In signing S. 1927, I am pleased to extend a most deserved benefit 
to our Nation's service-disabled veterans and the surviving spouses and 
children of those who gave their lives in defense of our beloved 
freedoms. This Act not only maintains the value of benefits so dearly 
earned, but underscores a debt of gratitude that we can never fully 
repay.
    S. 1927 provides a 2.8 percent increase in compensation and 
dependency and indemnity compensation benefits, effective December 1, 
1994. This is the same percentage increase that Social Security 
beneficiaries and veterans' pension recipients will be receiving in 
January.
    I salute the more than two and one-half million individuals who will 
directly benefit from this increase and all veterans and their families. 
Moreover, to those proud men and women still in uniform, our actions 
today bear witness to our Nation's commitment to you for your 
contributions to our security and well-being.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
October 25, 1994.

Note: S. 1927, approved October 25, was assigned Public Law No. 103-418.
