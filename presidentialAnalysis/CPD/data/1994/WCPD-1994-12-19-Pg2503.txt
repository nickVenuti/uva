Statement Congratulating Nobel Peace Prize Winners

December 11, 1994

    On behalf of the American people I wish to extend congratulations to 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Chairman Yasser Arafat, and Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres on being selected as the Nobel Peace Prize 
laureates for 1994.
    It was with great pride that we welcomed these leaders to the White 
House on September 13 last year to sign the historic Israel-Palestinian 
Declaration of Principles. It is fitting that this achievement be 
recognized by award of the Nobel Peace Prize and that the presentation 
take place in Norway, the country which contributed so much to making it 
possible.
    There is still much work to be done by all who support and share 
with this year's Nobel laureates the goal of a just, comprehensive, and 
lasting peace in the Middle East. The ceremony in the Oslo City Hall not 
only marks a great achievement, it encourages all of us to redouble our 
efforts to realize the promise of peace for all the people of the Middle 
East.
