Statement on Disaster Assistance to Alabama

March 3, 1994

    My heart goes out to the people of the South who have suffered from 
these recent storms. I know how difficult this winter has been, and I am 
confident that FEMA Director James Lee Witt will do all he can to assist 
the people of Alabama, and those throughout the rest of the South, to 
recover from these damaging storms.

Note: This statement was part of a White House press release on 
announcing disaster assistance to Alabama for winter storms beginning on 
January 14 and continuing through February 14.
