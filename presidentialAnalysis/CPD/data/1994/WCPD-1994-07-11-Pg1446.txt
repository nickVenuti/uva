Statement on Flooding in Alabama and Georgia and Fires in Colorado

July 8, 1994

    My thoughts and prayers are with the people back home who are 
battling these fires and floods and especially with the families of 
those who have lost their lives in the disaster. I have directed all the 
Federal departments who can help to make their most aggressive efforts 
to do so.

Note: This statement was part of a White House announcement on disaster 
assistance to Alabama.
