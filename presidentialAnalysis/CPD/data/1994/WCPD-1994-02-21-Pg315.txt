Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Kazakhstan and Romania

February 16, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Kazakhstan and 
Romania to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the 
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-
free access to the U.S. market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 
1974.
    I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 
and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, I have 
determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Kazakhstan 
and Romania.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
