Statement on the Death of Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr.

January 6, 1994

    The Nation mourns the loss of our beloved former Speaker of the 
House, Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, Jr.
    As U.S. House Speaker, Tip O'Neill was the Nation's most prominent, 
powerful, and loyal champion of working people. He loved politics and 
government because he saw how politics and government could make a 
difference in people's lives. And he loved people most of all--his 
neighbors, his constituents, and his family.
    Last fall, Tip was generous to me with his advice and his stature 
when he joined our effort to win approval of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. His stand moved me, because working people had been the 
cause of his long and colorful career, and in his heart he knew that 
more open trade would mean a better quality of life for working 
Americans.
    On a day of sadness for my family and Tip's, Hillary and I wish his 
wife, Millie, and their family our deepest sympathies for a husband and 
a father now gone and for a beautiful life well lived.
