Statement on Disaster Assistance for Florida and Georgia

December 23, 1994

    I am designating Federal emergency assistance today to help those 
communities in Florida and Georgia damaged by the recent severe weather. 
The people of both Franklin County, Florida, and Macon, Georgia, have 
worked hard to help those directly affected by the storm. As you 
continue with the clean-up, I hope this Federal assistance will aid in 
the economic recovery of both communities.

Note: This statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary 
announcing that emergency funding will be made available to Florida and 
Georgia to help the States recover from damage caused by Tropical Storm 
Alberto.
