Statement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Bosnia

December 31, 1994

    I welcome the agreement of the parties for a 4-month cessation of 
hostilities in Bosnia.
    We hope it will be respected fully and pave the way for a negotiated 
settlement that brings peace to all the long-suffering people of Bosnia.
    We applaud the flexibility that the parties have shown and commend 
the United Nations and former President Carter for their efforts.
    We will be working with our Contact Group partners, the United 
Nations, and the parties in a renewed effort to seize this opportunity 
for peace.
