Remarks on Iraq

October 8, 1994

    Before I leave today I just wanted to say one thing. I have been 
briefed by the National Security Advisor on the situation in Iraq. We 
have discussed the measures I have ordered to deal with the situation. 
And I want to make it clear one more time, it would be a grave error for 
Iraq to repeat the mistakes of the past or to misjudge either American 
will or American power.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 1:05 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House, prior to his departure for Camp David, MD.
