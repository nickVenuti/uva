Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister Jean-
Luc Dehaene of Belgium in Brussels

January 9, 1994

Bosnia

    Q. Mr. President, do you think that Bosnia should be at the top of 
the agenda for the NATO consideration?
    The President. Well, we'll discuss that and a number of other 
things. We have a lot of issues to discuss. But the Prime Minister and I 
will discuss that and several other issues. As you know, he's just ended 
a tour of 6 months in the presidency of the EU, and in my judgment, he 
and Belgium did a superb job. They were very instrumental in the 
successes we had last summer in the G-7 meeting, which laid the 
foundation for the adoption of the GATT round. So we're going to talk a 
little about that, too.

President's Mother

    Q. Mr. President, are you finding it difficult to engage in 
diplomacy after your personal loss?
    The President. No, I'm glad to be here. My family and my friends and 
my mother's friends, we had a wonderful day yesterday, and I'm doing 
what I should be doing. I'm glad to have the opportunity to be here and 
go back to work.

Note: The exchange began at 1:55 p.m. at the Conrad Hotel. A tape was
