Letter to Congressional Leaders on Ordering the Selected Reserve of the 
Armed Forces to Active Duty

September 15, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I have today, pursuant to section 673b of title 10, United States 
Code, authorized the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of 
Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating 
as a service within the Department of the Navy, to order to active duty 
any units, and any individual members not assigned to a unit organized 
to serve as a unit, of the Selected Reserve. The deployment of United 
States forces to conduct operational missions to restore the civilian 
government in Haiti necessitates this action.
    A copy of the Executive order implementing this action is attached.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
