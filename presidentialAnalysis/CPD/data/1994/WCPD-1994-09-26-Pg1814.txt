Message to the Congress Transmitting the China-United States Fishery 
Agreement

September 20, 1994

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement 
between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the People's Republic of China Extending the Agreement of 
July 23, 1985, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, 
as extended and amended. The Agreement, which was effected by an 
exchange of notes at Beijing on March 4 and May 31, 1994, extends the 
1985 Agreement to July 1, 1996.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
People's Republic of China, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
September 20, 1994.
