Statement on the 1996 Democratic National Convention

September 29, 1994

    I am pleased with Chairman Wilhelm's decision to name Debra DeLee to 
head the 1996 Democratic National Convention. I am confident her energy 
and enthusiasm as well as her political expertise will make the 1996 
convention an exciting and rewarding experience for those inside the 
convention hall, throughout Chicago, and across America.
