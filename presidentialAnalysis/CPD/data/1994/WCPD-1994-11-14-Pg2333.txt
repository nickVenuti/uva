Letter to Congressional Leaders on Cyprus

November 7, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I am 
submitting to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement 
of the Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through 
July 31, 1994. The current report covers the period August 1, 1994, 
through September 30, 1994.
    During this time frame U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher met regularly 
with the leaders of the two communities. He is working closely with the 
United Nations in an effort to bring Mr. Clerides and Mr. Denktash 
together for face-to-face meetings. I am very concerned with the lack of 
progress during this period and believe direct meetings between the two 
leaders are crucial to avoid an impasse.
    James Williams was appointed on October 21 as U.S. Special 
Coordinator for Cyprus. He will travel shortly to Athens, Ankara, and 
Nicosia to consult with the parties.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Claiborne Pell, chairman, Senate Committee 
on Foreign Relations.
