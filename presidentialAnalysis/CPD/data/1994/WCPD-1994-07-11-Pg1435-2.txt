Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus

July 7, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I am 
submitting to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement 
of the Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through 
March 1, 1994. The current report covers the remainder of March through 
May 20, 1994.
    This has been a very active period for negotiations on the U.N. 
proposed package of confidence-building measures. I hope that in my next 
report, I will be able to state that progress has been made.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Claiborne Pell, chairman, Senate Committee 
on Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office of the 
Press Secretary on July 8.
