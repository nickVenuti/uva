Message on the Observance of Armed Forces Day, 1994

May 21, 1994

    Greetings to the men and women of the Armed Forces stationed around 
the world as we celebrate Armed Forces Day, 1994. On behalf of the 
American people, I am proud to extend heartfelt appreciation for your 
tremendous service to our country.
    Each of you who wears our nation's uniform makes an invaluable 
contribution to the safety, security, and well-being of the United 
States and of the entire world. Some of you serve here at home, while 
others are posted the world over, but all of you work to guard our 
precious freedom and to further the goals of peace and democracy. In 
addition to these traditional military roles, you have set a new 
standard of excellence for international humanitarian efforts--bringing 
food, shelter, and medical relief to people in desperate need.
    On this important day, I am honored to salute the hard-working 
individuals serving in the Army, the Marine Corps, the Navy, the Air 
Force, and the Coast Guard. American owes you a debt of gratitude for 
all that you have done for our Nation and for all that you continue to 
do to protect the blessings of liberty we cherish.
                                                  Bill Clinton
