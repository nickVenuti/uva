Statement by the Press Secretary on the President's Meeting With Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua of China

May 2, 1994

Haiti

    President Clinton met today in the Oval Office with Chinese Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua. The meeting, which lasted 40 minutes, provided both 
sides with an opportunity to exchange views on the current state of 
U.S.-China relations.
    President Clinton told the Vice Premier that the United States wants 
to see a strong, stable, and prosperous China. The President emphasized 
that he wants to strengthen our bilateral relationship, but to 
accomplish that goal there needs to be progress on human rights as 
called for in last year's Executive order.
    Vice Premier Zou was accompanied, among others, by Vice Foreign 
Minister Liu Hiaqui, Vice Minister Zeng Peiyan from the State Planning 
Commission, and Ambassador Li Daoyu.
