Statement on Presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 
William H. Natcher

March 4, 1994

    Congressman Natcher has served the people of Kentucky and this 
Nation with distinction since 1941. He is revered by friends and 
opponents alike, and I can think of no person who deserves our 
recognition more. He represents the model of leadership to which we 
should all strive.

Note: The President traveled to Bethesda Naval Hospital, Bethesda, MD, 
where he presented Representative Natcher with the medal. This statement 
was part of a White House press release announcing the award.
