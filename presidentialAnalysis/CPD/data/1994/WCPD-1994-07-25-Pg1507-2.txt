Statement on Flood Assistance to Georgia, Alabama, and Florida

July 18, 1994

    The people in the flooded areas face a difficult task in recovering 
from this major disaster. Our first priority is to help them get their 
lives in order. These funds will help farmers to clear their property 
and get their operations running again. They will also help elderly, low 
income homeowners to restore their damaged homes.

Note: This statement was part of a White House announcement of 
additional assistance to States affected by flooding in the Southeast.
