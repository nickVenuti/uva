September 8, 1994

    The President today announced his intention to appoint Barbara K. 
Rimer, Dr. P.H., of Duke University, as Chair and member of the National 
Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB).
    ``The NCAB plays a critical role by providing advice on the Federal 
cancer research effort,'' the President said. ``Dr. Rimer has 
demonstrated her ability to meld insight from the biological and 
behavioral sciences into new approaches to cancer control, and I look 
forward to her leadership of the NCAB.''
