Nomination for Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services 
Administration

April 20, 1994

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Fredric K. 
Schroeder as Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration 
(RSA).
    ``As one who gradually became blind as a teenager, Dr. Schroeder 
knows all too well the challenges facing people with disabilities,'' the 
President said. ``He has devoted his life to empowering disabled people, 
and I'm confident he will continue in his new assignment to help 
disabled Americans achieve their goals.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
