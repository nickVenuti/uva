Christmas Greeting to the Nation

December 24, 1994

    The President. On this special day, we send our best wishes to you 
and your family, and especially to the families of our service men and 
women who are so many miles away from home this Christmas, doing 
America's work overseas, keeping the peace in the Persian Gulf, and 
bringing freedom and democracy to Haiti. We salute them as they make the 
world a safer place for all of us, for our children and for future 
generations.
    Hillary Clinton. And we thank all of you who are giving your time 
today serving others, the police and fire and medical staffs on

duty and all the mothers and fathers, friends and volunteers who are 
caring for loved ones and neighbors nearby. Thank you all for spreading 
good will and for showing what the true spirit of Christmas is all 
about.

and peace of this blessed season and good health and happiness 
throughout the coming year. Enjoy the holiday.
