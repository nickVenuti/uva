Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With the Russian Federation

December 29, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    On September 21, 1994, I determined and reported to the Congress 
that the Russian Federation is in full compliance with the freedom of 
emigration criteria of section 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. 
This action allowed for the continuation of most-favored-nation (MFN) 
status for Russia and certain other activities without the requirement 
of a waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the 
Congress concerning the emigration laws and policies of the Russian 
Federation. You will find that the report indicates continued Russian 
compliance with U.S. and international standards in the area of 
emigration.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
