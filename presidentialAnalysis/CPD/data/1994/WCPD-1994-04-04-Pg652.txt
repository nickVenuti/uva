Message on the Observance of Easter, 1994

March 30, 1994

    Warmest greetings to all who are observing Easter Sunday. Easter is 
a time of hope and great joy for Christians the world over. It is a time 
to reflect on the blessings of rebirth, as the seasons transform and the 
cycle of life renews itself once again. This celebration holds the 
promise of new beginnings, fresh approaches to old problems, and the 
exciting prospect of a brighter future.
    On this day when families gather together and worshipers attend 
church services, we hope for a stronger sense of community in this great 
nation. As we welcome the return of spring, let us rededicate ourselves 
to a season of renewed hope and faith, a season of peace and 
regeneration.
    Hillary and I extend our best wishes for a happy Easter.
                                                  Bill Clinton
