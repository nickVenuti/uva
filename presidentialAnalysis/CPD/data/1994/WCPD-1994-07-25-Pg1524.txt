Memorandum on Assistance to the Caucasus

Presidential Determination No. 94-36

Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture

Subject: Food Security Wheat Reserve Release

    By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Food 
Security Wheat Reserve Act of 1980 (the ``Act'') (7 U.S.C. 1736f-1), I 
hereby authorize the release in fiscal year 1994 of up to 200,000 metric 
tons of wheat from the reserve established under the Act (the 
``reserve'') for use under Title II of the Agricultural Trade 
Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to meet relief

needs that exist in the Caucasus region of the former Soviet Union, 
which I hereby determine are suffering severe food shortages. The wheat 
will be used to provide urgent humanitarian relief to the peoples in 
this region who are suffering widespread hunger and malnutrition.
    This action is taken because wheat needed for relief in this region 
cannot be programmed for such purpose in a timely manner under the 
normal means of obtaining commodities for food assistance due to 
circumstances of unanticipated and exceptional need.
    You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the 
Federal Register.
                                            William J. Clinton
