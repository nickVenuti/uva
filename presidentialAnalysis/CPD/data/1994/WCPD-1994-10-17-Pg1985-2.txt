Statement on California Desert Legislation

October 8, 1994

    Today's passage of the California desert bill is a clear-cut victory 
for the people of California and everyone across America who cares about 
this Nation's great natural heritage. We all owe a debt of gratitude to 
Senator Dianne Feinstein for her tireless efforts to bring together a 
bipartisan coalition in Congress that ensured its passage.
    The passage of this important environmental legislation is a 
testament to Dianne Feinstein's skillful leadership, perseverance, and 
determination to do the right thing for the people of California.
