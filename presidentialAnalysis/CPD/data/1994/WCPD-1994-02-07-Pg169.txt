Statement on Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts' Decision Not To Seek 
Reelection

January 28, 1994

    It was with regret that I learned of Oregon Governor Barbara 
Roberts' decision not to seek reelection.
    I have been very fortunate to work with the Governor on issues 
affecting the people of the Northwest and the Nation: health care, 
economic opportunity, and the protection of our natural resources. Her 
leadership on these and other issues will be missed.
    I commend Governor Roberts for her dedication to the people of 
Oregon throughout her 20 years of public service. My best wishes go out 
to the Governor and her family.
