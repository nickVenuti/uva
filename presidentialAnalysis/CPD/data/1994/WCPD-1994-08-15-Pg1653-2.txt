    Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(1) the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2318(a)(1) (the 
``Act''), I hereby determine that:

military assistance to Jamaica; and

the Arms Export Control Act or any other law except section 506 of the

services of the Department of Defense, and military education and 
training to Jamaica.
    The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this 
determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the 
Federal Register.
