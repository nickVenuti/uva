Letter to Congressional Leaders on Most-Favored-Nation Trade Status for 
China

June 2, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Pursuant to subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended, 19 U.S.C. 2432(d)(1) (``the Act''), I hereby submit the 
attached report concerning the continuation of a waiver of application 
of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act to the People's 
Republic of China. The report explains my reasons for having determined 
that continuation of the waiver currently in affect for the People's 
Republic of China will substantially promote the objectives of section 
402.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
