September 8, 1994

    The President today announced his intention to reappoint Harold P. 
Freeman, M.D., of Harlem Hospital Center, New York, as Chair and member

member group providing advice to the President on various aspects of the 
National Cancer Program. Dr. Freeman has chaired the Panel since 1991.
    ``The President's Cancer Panel plays an essential role in monitoring 
the Nation's cancer program and guiding its progress into the future,'' 
the President said. ``I admire Dr. Freeman's commitment to reducing 
death and suffering from cancer during this time of significant progress 
and considerable challenge in cancer research. The National Cancer 
Program is vital to our Nation's health.''
