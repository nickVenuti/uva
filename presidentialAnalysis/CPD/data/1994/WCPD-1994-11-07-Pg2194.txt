Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Prince Bandar in 
Hafal-Batin, Saudi Arabia

October 28, 1994

King Abdul-Aziz Medal

    Q. Your Majesty, would you care to tell us what the decoration was, 
what its purpose was, Prince Bandar?
    Prince Bandar. This is the highest medal in the kingdom, that His 
Majesty awarded the President for his gratitude for the President of the 
United States of America and the people of the United States.
    The President. You all are holding up well?
    Q. No, are you?
    Q. What are you going to do with all your medals now? Put them in 
your library?
    The President. No, I'm going to wear them to my press conference and 
hope that I'll get more respect. [Laughter] I'll just wait until a 
difficult question arises, and I will put it on and hope it serves as a 
shield.

Note: The exchange began at 9:43 p.m. at the Royal Compound Reception
