Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on the Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund

February 2, 1994

Dear Mr. Chairman:

    I transmit herewith the first annual report on the status of the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund as required by section 330 of the Water 
Resources Development Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-580). This report 
covers the history of the Trust Fund from its inception in 1987 through 
fiscal year 1992.
    The Harbor Maintenance Fee and Trust Fund program now provides 100 
percent of the operations and maintenance expenditures for those 
activities of the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation and the 
Army Corps of Engineers, which benefit commercial navigation. In fiscal 
year 1992, nearly $500 million was appropriated from the Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund for such purposes. This report provides an 
evaluation of the Trust Fund, including its administration, use, and 
prospects for the future.

    I have delegated responsibility for transmittal of this report in 
future years to the Secretary of Defense.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Norman Y. Mineta, Chairman, House 
Committee on Public Works and Transportation, and Max Baucus, Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
