Memorandum on the 1994 Combined Federal Campaign

September 9, 1994

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

    I am delighted that Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary has agreed 
to serve as the chair of the 1994 Combined Federal Campaign of the 
National Capital Area. I ask you to support the campaign by personally 
chairing the campaign in your Agency and appointing a top official as 
your vice chair.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. This year our goal 
is to raise more than $38 million. Public servants not only contribute 
to the campaign but assume leadership roles to ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help guarantee another 
successful campaign this year.
                                            William J. Clinton
