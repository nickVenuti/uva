Statement on the Attack on Sarajevo

February 5, 1994

    I am outraged by this deliberate attack on the people of Sarajevo. 
There can be no possible military justification for an attack against a 
marketplace where women, men, and children of the city were pursuing 
their everyday lives. The United Nations should urgently investigate 
this incident and clearly identify those who are guilty.
    I have directed that Secretary Christopher engage our allies in 
Europe and the United Nations on the situation and on appropriate next 
steps. As he and Secretary of Defense Perry have stated, we rule nothing 
out.
    I have also directed the Department of Defense to offer its 
assistance in evacuating, hospitalizing, and treating those injured in 
this savage attack.
    I know I speak for all Americans in expressing our revulsion and 
anger at this cowardly act.
