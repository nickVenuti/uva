Statement on the Nomination of Phil Lader as Small Business 
Administrator

September 23, 1994

    I have today announced my intention to nominate Philip Lader as 
Administrator of the Small Business Administration.
    Upon Mr. Lader's confirmation by the Senate, the SBA Administrator 
will hold Cabinet rank and serve as a member of my Cabinet.
    The elevation of the SBA Administrator to Cabinet status reflects my 
firm commitment to address the interests and concerns of the Nation's 
small business community. By sitting as a member of the Cabinet, the SBA 
Administrator can ensure that the views of our small business community 
are expressed and heard in the most senior levels of Government.
    Small business is the backbone of our economy and the driving force 
behind economic growth. We have already taken major strides in making 
the SBA an effective agency for enhancing the strength of our Nation's 
small businesses. In giving the Administrator Cabinet status, we will 
accelerate that progress.
