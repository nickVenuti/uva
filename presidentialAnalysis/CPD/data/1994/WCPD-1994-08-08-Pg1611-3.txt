Appointment of Interim National AIDS Policy Coordinator

August 2, 1994

    The President today appointed Patricia S. Fleming to serve as 
interim National AIDS Policy Coordinator.
    Ms. Fleming, currently special assistant to Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala, will serve until a permanent 
coordinator takes office.
    ``This administration has made significant strides in the fight 
against this terrible epidemic. We've increased our budgets for AIDS 
research, treatment, and prevention and have fought hard to provide 
health insurance for all Americans, regardless of preexisting 
conditions. Patsy Fleming will make sure we don't lose our momentum,'' 
said the President.
