Statement by the Press Secretary on United States Counterintelligence 
Effectiveness

May 3, 1994

    President Clinton signed today a Presidential Decision Directive on 
U.S. counterintelligence effectiveness to foster increased cooperation, 
coordination, and accountability among all U.S. counterintelligence 
agencies. The President has directed the creation of a new national 
counterintelligence policy structure under the auspices of the National 
Security Council. In addition, he has directed the creation of a new 
National Counterintelligence Center, initially to be led by a senior 
executive of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Finally, the 
President's Decision Directive requires that exchange of senior managers 
between the CIA and the FBI to ensure timely and close coordination 
between the intelligence and law enforcement communities.
    The President's decision to take these significant steps of 
restructuring U.S. counterintelligence policy and interagency 
coordination, followed a Presidential review of U.S. counterintelligence 
in the wake of the Aldrich Ames espionage investigation. The President, 
in issuing this Directive, has taken immediate steps to improve our 
ability to counter both traditional and new threats to our Nation's 
security in the post-cold-war era.
