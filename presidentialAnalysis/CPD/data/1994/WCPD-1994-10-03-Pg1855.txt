Statement on Haiti

September 25, 1994

    We regret any loss of life in connection with our mission in Haiti, 
but it must be clear that U.S. forces are prepared to respond to hostile 
action against them and will do so. We will continue to work with 
Haitian military authorities for a peaceful transition.
