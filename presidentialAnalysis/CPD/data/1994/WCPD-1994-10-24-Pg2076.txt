Statement on Maritime Legislation

October 19, 1994

    The American maritime industry plays an important role in our 
Nation's economy and security. Under Secretary Pena's leadership, we 
have made significant progress implementing a program that enhances the 
competitiveness of American shipyards in the international commercial 
market. But our work is not complete.
    Congress still must act to ensure a maritime presence in the United 
States' vast international trade. It must act to ensure that a fleet of 
U.S.-flag merchant ships, crewed by skilled American seafarers, stands 
ready to serve our country's economic and military sealift needs. The 
administration looks forward to working with the next Congress to enact 
legislation that achieves these important goals.
