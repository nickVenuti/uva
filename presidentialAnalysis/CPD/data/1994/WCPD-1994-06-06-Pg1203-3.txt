Subject: Determination Under Section 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, 
as Amended--Continuation of Waiver Authority

    Pursuant to section 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
(``the Act''), I determine that the further extension of the waiver 
authority granted by section 402(c) of the Act will substantially 
promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act. I further determine 
that the continuation of the waivers applicable to Albania, Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Mongolia, 
Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan will 
substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act.
    You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the 
Federal Register.
