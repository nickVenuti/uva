Message to Congress on Trade With South Africa

April 21, 1994

To the Congress of the United States:

    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add South Africa to the 
list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. 
market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
    I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 
and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, I have 
determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to South 
Africa.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
April 21, 1994.
