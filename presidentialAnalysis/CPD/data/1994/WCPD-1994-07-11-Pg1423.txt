Statement on Relocating Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty Headquarters

July 5, 1994

    The Radios made a significant contribution to the victory of freedom 
during the cold war. All friends of liberty appreciate the strong 
support of the German Government and in particular the Bavarian 
officials over the last four decades. With this move, the Radios begin a 
new chapter in the continuing struggle to consolidate democracy 
throughout the former Communist bloc. I am grateful to President Havel 
and the Czech Government for its generous offer and look forward to 
working with it to ensure the Radios' important work continues.

Note: This statement was part of a statement by the Press Secretary on 
the decision to accept the offer of the Czech Government to make the 
former Parliament building in Prague available to Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty.
