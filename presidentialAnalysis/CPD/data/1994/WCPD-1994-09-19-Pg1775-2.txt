Message to the Senate Transmitting the Ukraine-United States Taxation 
Convention and Protocol

September 14, 1994

To the Senate of the United States:

    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of Ukraine for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and 
the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and 
Capital, with Protocol, signed at Washington on March 4, 1994. Also 
transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the 
Department of State with respect to the Convention.

[[Page 1776]]

    The Convention replaces, with respect to Ukraine, the 1973 income 
tax convention between the United States of America and the Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics. It will modernize tax relations between the 
two countries and will facilitate greater private sector United States 
investment in Ukraine.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Convention and related Protocol and give its advice and consent 
to ratification.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
September 14, 1994.
