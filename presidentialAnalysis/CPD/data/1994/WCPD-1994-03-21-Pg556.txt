Message on the Observance of St. Patrick's Day

March 17, 1994

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Saint Patrick's Day 1994. On 
this feast of the patron Saint of Ireland, we reflect on Saint Patrick's 
bravery and determination in delivering to the Irish people his message 
of faith and hope for the future--a spirit passed down through the many 
generations that followed.
    With tremendous courage and strength of belief, Saint Patrick helped 
his native Ireland usher in a new era. Before Patrick returned to his 
island home as a Christian convert and missionary, Ireland was the last 
bastion of Celtic Europe. He encouraged the Irish people to adapt their 
ancient culture and deep spirituality to the new faith that had already

alded a new Eire and prepared his people to embrace the changing world 
around them.
    In celebrating Saint Patrick's Day, our nation not only remembers 
the apostle of Ireland for his achievements, but we also honor the many 
contributions that Irish Americans have made to their adopted homeland. 
As inheritors of Saint Patrick's legacy, Irish Americans have 
strengthened the United States with the richness of their unique 
history. Blessed with educators and business people, political leaders 
and people of faith, our nation owes a debt of gratitude to this 
thriving community from the Emerald Isle.
    As Americans everywhere gather to celebrate our ``Irishness,'' I 
extend best wishes to all for a wonderful St. Patrick's Day.
