Statement by the Press Secretary on the Death of Foreign Minister Johan 
Jurgen Holst of Norway

January 14, 1994

    The President was saddened to learn yesterday of the death of 
Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jurgen Holst. Throughout his long and 
distinguished career, Minister Holst was one of the world's leading 
experts and wisest thinkers on international security issues. As his 
nation's defense minister, head of a leading research institute, and 
foreign minister, he was in the forefront of those designing and 
implementing international security policies during the cold war and 
adapting those policies to the post-cold-war period.
    Americans remember him best for his leading role in the Israeli-PLO 
negotiations that led to the breakthrough in the Middle East peace 
process last September. The President was proud to have the opportunity 
to honor Minister Holst at the White House signing ceremony on September 
13.
    The White House expresses its deepest sympathies to the family and 
friends of this great statesman.
