Statement on the Death of John Britton and James Barrett

July 29, 1994

    I strongly condemn the senseless shootings today which abruptly 
ended the lives of two men and seriously wounded a third in Pensacola, 
Florida.
    The safety, freedom, and protection of all our citizens is paramount 
in guaranteeing the health and vitality of our Nation. I am strongly 
committed to ending this form of domestic terrorism that threatens the 
fabric of our country. I encourage a quick and thorough investigation 
into this tragic incident as the local officials work closely with the 
resources of the Federal law enforcement community.
    Hillary and I extend our deepest sympathy to the friends and family 
of Dr. John Britton and Mr. James Barrett on their tragic loss today, 
and I speak for all Americans in expressing my hope for a full and 
complete recovery for Mrs. June Barrett.
