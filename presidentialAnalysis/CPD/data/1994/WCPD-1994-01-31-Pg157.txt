January 25, 1994

    The President announced his intention today to nominate Rear Admiral 
Robert E. Kramek, USCG, to be the 20th Commandant of the U.S. Coast 
Guard.
    ``Admiral Kramek has served his country proudly for 33 years and has 
distinguished himself through his performance in a number of challenging 
assignments,'' said the President. ``He has consistently demonstrated 
the strong leadership ability the Coast Guard needs to remain the vital 
service that it always has been. I am confident that he will perform up 
to the high standards set by his predecessor, Adm. Bill Kime.''
