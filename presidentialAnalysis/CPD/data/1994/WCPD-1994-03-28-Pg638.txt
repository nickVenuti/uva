Message on the Observance of Passover

March 25, 1994

    Heartfelt greetings to all who are gathered to celebrate Passover.
    This joyous festival of liberation reminds all of us of the 
importance of freedom. The Passover seder, filled with its symbols of 
confinement and liberty, of pain and joy, has served as a means of 
teaching each new generation the story of the Jews' liberation from 
slavery in Egypt. As children learn the ancient account, they understand 
that freedom is something for which we must continuously struggle and 
that we must always cherish.
    Human history is filled with chronicles of peoples throwing off the 
shackles of their oppressors to embrace the causes of justice and 
equality. As new nations begin their journeys to a ``promised land,'' 
the lessons of Passover echo in every corner of the Earth. They teach us 
that while we must be thankful for the freedom we have, we must also 
remember all those in the world who still yearn to know its many gifts. 
This year, let us rededicate ourselves to extending the blessings of 
liberty to all who seek it.
    During this historic season of renewal and peace, Hillary and I 
extend warm wishes for a memorable and meaningful Passover.
                                                  Bill Clinton
