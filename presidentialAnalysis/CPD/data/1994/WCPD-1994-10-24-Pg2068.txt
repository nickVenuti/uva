Statement on Flooding in Texas

October 18, 1994

    My thoughts are with the people of Texas during this crisis. With 
the help of our team down in Texas, I will continue to monitor the 
situation closely.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
that the President has directed Secretary of Transportation Federico 
Pena, Small Business Administrator Phil Lader, and officials from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency to travel to Texas to survey flood 
damage.
