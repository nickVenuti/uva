Remarks at the Anchorage Museum of Art and History in Anchorage, Alaska

November 11, 1994

    Well, let me just say, as I said out at the base, I've been trying 
for 2 years to get to Alaska, and I finally made it today. And I

thank the Governor, the Senator, and the mayor for coming out to meet 
Hillary and me. I also want to say that this is my first trip to Alaska, 
now I can say that in the last couple of years I've been to every State 
in America. And I hope I'll be coming back. But it's not Hillary's first 
trip to Alaska; she is coming back. She worked here 25 years ago when 
she was about 6 and violated the child labor law. [Laughter]
    So I thought I would just ask her to come up here and say a word, 
because it's been--this has been a very meaningful trip to her. I was 
trying to get a little sleep, and when we started--we finally got into 
the airspace of Alaska, she was beating on me, saying, ``Wake up, wake 
up, look at this, look at this.'' [Laughter] So I heard the story again 
for the 500th time. [Laughter] Which I love. Now, I can tell it as well.
    So please come up and say a word.
