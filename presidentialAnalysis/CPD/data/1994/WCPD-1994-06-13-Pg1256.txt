Statement on Assistance to California

June 7, 1994

    Californians have been working extraordinarily hard to get their 
homes, their businesses, and their lives back to normal. This is 
creating unexpected and unprecedented need for assistance from the 
Federal Government. This recommendation should assure the people of 
southern California that our commitment to help them get back on their 
feet remains strong and unwavering.

Note: The President's statement was included in a statement by Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers on the President's request to Congress for 
additional funds to assist the State of California in the wake of the 
earthquake earlier this year.
