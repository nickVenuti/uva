Message to the Congress on Trade With Ukraine

March 3, 1994

To the Congress of the United States:

    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Ukraine to the list 
of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. 
market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
    I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 
and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, and 
particularly Ukraine's level of development and initiation of economic 
reforms, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits 
to Ukraine.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
March 3, 1994.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
March 4.
