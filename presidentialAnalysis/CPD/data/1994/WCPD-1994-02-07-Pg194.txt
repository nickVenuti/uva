Nomination for a Member of the Board of Directors of the African 
Development Foundation

February 2, 1994

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate John F. 
Hicks, Jr., to be a member of the Board of Directors of the African 
Development Foundation. The African Development Foundation is an 
independent, nonprofit Government corporation which seeks to provide 
self-help initiatives to the poor populations of Africa. Last week, the 
President announced his intention to nominate Willie Grace Campbell and 
Marion M. Dawson to be among the Board's members.
    ``John Hicks has served our country well for almost 20 years and 
knows what the developing economies of Africa need in order to 
prosper,'' said the President. ``He will be a strong addition to the 
African Development Foundation's Board.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
