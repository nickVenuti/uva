Statement on Withdrawal of Russian Forces From Eastern Europe

August 31, 1994

    Today marks the completion of the withdrawal of Russian military 
forces from the Republic of Estonia and the Latvian Republic, under 
terms of bilateral agreements concluded between Russia and each of these 
sovereign states. Russian military forces are also completing their 
withdrawal today from the Federal Republic of Germany, in accordance 
with the agreements reached between Germany and the Soviet Union in 
October 1990. These withdrawals constitute the final departure of 
Russian troops that have been present in Eastern Europe since 1945.
    This effectively brings to an end a chapter in post-World War II 
European history, opening the door to a new era of regional stability 
and cooperation. I congratulate the
