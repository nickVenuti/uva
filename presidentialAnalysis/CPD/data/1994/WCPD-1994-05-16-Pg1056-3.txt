Mabus, Jr., of Mississippi, as Ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia.

of that State with distinction,'' the President said. ``He brings the 
leadership and vision he has demonstrated throughout his years of public 
service to this critical assignment. I am pleased to nominate him as my 
personal representative to Saudi Arabia.''
