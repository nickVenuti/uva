Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi of Italy in Rome

June 2, 1994

    Q. Mr. President, North Korea's being very threatening--making more 
statements about--the talks that you've undertaken--talks of tough 
sanctions. What do you say to that?
    The President. We're going to have a question period, I think, 
afterward. The Prime Minister and I will make statements and then answer 
questions. I'd rather answer questions then.

President's Visit

    Q. Any general impressions so far--just about how things are going?
    The President. It's been a very good trip so far. I've been very 
impressed, pleased with the reception, pleased with the support for the 
United States.

Note: The exchange began at 3:34 p.m. in Room 123, Piano Primo at the 
Palazzo Chigi. A tape was not available for verification of the content
