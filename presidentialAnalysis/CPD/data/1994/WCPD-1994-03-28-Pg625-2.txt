Statement Announcing a Meeting With Native Americans

March 23, 1994

    I look forward to this historic meeting and to affirming our 
commitment to strengthening the nation-to-nation relationship we have 
with tribal governments.

Note: This statement was part of a White House press release announcing 
a meeting with American Indian and Alaska Native tribal leaders at the 
White House on April 29.
