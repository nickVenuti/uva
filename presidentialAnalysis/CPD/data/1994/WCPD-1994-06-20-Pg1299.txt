Remarks at the Opening Day Ceremonies for World Cup Soccer in Chicago

June 17, 1994

    Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, citizens of 
the world, the United States is honored to play host to this magnificent 
celebration. The World Cup has captured the imagination of our country, 
as has the game itself in the last few years. The love of soccer is now 
a universal language that binds us all together. So I welcome all who 
have come from all countries and all continents and all who will watch 
these games in the United States for the next 30 days.
    We will reward with our cheers the courage and skill of all the 
players. Let us, in the process, come to appreciate the unity of people 
throughout the world that this game represents. I say especially to 
President Sanchez and the people of Bolivia, buena suerte today. To 
Chancellor Kohl and the people of Deutschland, viel gluck. Good luck to 
you all and welcome to the United States.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 1:40 p.m. at Soldier Field. A tape was not
