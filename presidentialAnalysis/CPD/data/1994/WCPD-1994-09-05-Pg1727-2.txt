Statement on the Death of Drug Enforcement Administration Agents

August 30, 1994

    I join the American people in mourning the deaths of five young 
agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration, lost when their plane 
crashed in Peru this past weekend. Agents Frank Fernandez, Jay Seale, 
Meredith Thompson, Frank Wallace, and Juan Vars demonstrated a true 
devotion to duty and a commitment to ridding our country of the scourge 
of illegal drugs.
    Every day, dedicated men and women risk their lives in the 
international war against drugs. Working with officials from many 
nations, our DEA agents have made great progress in this struggle. But, 
as we have seen this week, this war is not an easy one. Even our most 
valiant young soldiers fall victim.
    These courageous agents served to make America's streets safer for 
our children, and, in their names, we rededicate ourselves to fighting 
drug production, trafficking, and use.
    On behalf of a grateful nation, I extend deepest sympathies to the 
families of these heroic individuals. Their bright lives will remain 
inspirations to all of us.
                                            William J. Clinton
