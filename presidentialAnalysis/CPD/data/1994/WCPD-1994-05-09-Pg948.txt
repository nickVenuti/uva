Remarks on the Situation in Rwanda

April 30, 1994

    The horrors of civil war and mass killings of civilians in Rwanda, 
since the tragic deaths of the Rwandan and Burundian Presidents 3 weeks 
ago, have shocked and appalled the world community.
    On behalf of all of the American people, I call on the Rwandan army 
and the Rwandan Patriotic Front to agree to an immediate cease-fire and 
return to negotiations aimed at a lasting peace in their country.
    I applaud the efforts of regional leaders actively engaged in the 
quest for peace. I reaffirm the American commitment to participate in 
renewed negotiations under the Arusha framework.
    The pain and suffering of the Rwandan people have touched the hearts 
of all Americans. It is time for the leaders of Rwanda to recognize 
their common bond of humanity and to reject the senseless and criminal 
violence violence that continues to plague their country.

Note: The President spoke at 10:12 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. His remarks were made available for broadcast on nationwide 
radio.
