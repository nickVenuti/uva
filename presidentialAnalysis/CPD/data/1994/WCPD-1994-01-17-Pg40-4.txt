Exchange With Reporters Prior To Discussions With President Michal Kovac 
of the Slovak Republic in Prague

January 12, 1994

Partnership For Peace

    Q. President Clinton, what's been the reception so far to what you 
have brought to these nations?
    The President. So far, so good.

    Q. No objections, sir?
    The President. We've had three different conversations, of course, 
and this will be the fourth. And each of them, although leaders can 
characterize them for themselves, but I have been very pleased so far.
    Q. Have they raised security issues with you, that they are worried 
that if there should be some kind of resurgence in Russia that they feel 
protected, or are they still worried about this?
    The President. No one has said that they expect something like that 
in the near future. What no one knows is whether the future of Europe 
will be like its past or if it will be different.
    Q. Are you saying that all have accepted the Partnership so far?
    The President. You'll have to ask them when we do the press 
conference.

Note: The exchange began at 11:06 a.m. in the library at the U.S. 
Ambassador's Residence. A tape was not available for verification of the
