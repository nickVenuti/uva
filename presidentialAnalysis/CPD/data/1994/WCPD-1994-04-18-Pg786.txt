Statement on the Nonprofit Liaison Network

April 12, 1994

    I have long advocated the role of the nonprofit sector. Throughout 
our history, the nonprofit community has helped our Nation adapt to a 
changing world by strengthening the core values that shape American 
life. Today, that role has never been more important. The nonprofit 
liaison network will create better collaboration between the 
administration and advocacy and service groups in a mutual effort to 
solve the problems of crime, housing, health care, and other pressing 
national needs.

Note: This statement was included in a White House press release 
announcing the nonprofit liaison network.
