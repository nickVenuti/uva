Letter Accepting Morton H. Halperin's Withdrawal as a Nominee To Be an 
Assistant Secretary of Defense

January 10, 1994

Dear Mort:

    I have received your letter asking that I not resubmit your 
nomination to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for Democracy and 
Peacekeeping. With deep appreciation for your willingness to serve our 
country and with real regret, I accept your request.
    Yours is a superb record of service and accomplishment dating back 
over 30 years. Your qualifications speak for themselves, and I am 
pleased to hear that your willingness to serve my Administration 
continues unabated.
    At the same time, I appreciate your understanding of the 
circumstances involved in a new Secretary of Defense coming on board and 
the tradition of Cabinet officers having the freedom to select 
subordinates.
    I am confident that this Administration will continue to benefit 
from your talent and counsel and hope that you will be available for 
other suitable assignments.
    Sincerely,
                                                  Bill Clinton

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also made available Mr. 
Halperin's letter requesting that his nomination to be Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Democracy and Peacekeeping be withdrawn.
