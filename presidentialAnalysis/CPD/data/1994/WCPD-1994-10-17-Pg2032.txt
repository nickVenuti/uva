Statement on Federal Funding for the Homeless

October 14, 1994

    I am pleased to announce the release of these much-needed funds to 
help feed, shelter, and give a hand-up to America's homeless. By 
involving local community organizations as we decide where to best 
allocate these resources, we will ensure that the most urgent needs in 
our communities are met.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the release of $130 million in funding to feed and shelter the homeless.
