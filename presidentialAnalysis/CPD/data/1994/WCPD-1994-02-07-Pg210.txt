Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Implementation 
of the Privacy Act

February 3, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I am pleased to forward the enclosed report on the Federal agencies' 
implementation of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a). 
The report covers calendar years 1990 and 1991.
    In addition to the data required to be reported by the statute, the 
report also describes agencies' efforts in training their employees to 
carry out the provisions of the Privacy Act responsibly and reliably.
    While agencies continue to meet their responsibilities under the 
Act, they are becoming increasingly concerned about how the Act's 
provisions will work in a computerized environment. A challenge for the 
years ahead will be to harmonize the provisions of the Privacy Act with 
the technologies that are now coming into play.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Robert C. Byrd, President pro tempore of 
the Senate.
