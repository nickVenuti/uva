Statement on the Implementation of the National Voter Registration Act 
of 1993

September 12, 1994

    This law creates the opportunity to include millions of Americans in 
the political process who have previously been excluded because of 
difficult and confusing voting rules. I urge all Americans of all 
political parties to register to vote, and I urge the voter registration 
groups to continue and expand their efforts to ensure as many of our 
citizens as possible are registered.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
that the President signed Executive Order 12926--Implementation of the 
National Voter Registration Act of 1993.
