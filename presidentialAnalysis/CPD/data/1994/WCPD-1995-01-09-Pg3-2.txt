Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Bulgaria

December 30, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    On June 3, 1993, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Bulgaria is in full compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria 
of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This action allowed 
for the continuation of most-favored-nation (MFN) status for Bulgaria 
and certain other activities without the requirement of a waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated Report to Congress 
concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of Bulgaria. You 
will find that the report indicates continued Bulgarian compliance with 
U.S. and international standards in the areas of emigration and human 
rights policy.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on January 
3, 1995.
