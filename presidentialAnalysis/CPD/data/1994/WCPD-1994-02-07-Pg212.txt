Memorandum on Trade With Vietnam

February 3, 1994

Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Treasury, the 
Secretary of Commerce

Subject: Lifting of the Embargo Against Vietnam

    I hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury to take all 
appropriate actions to authorize prospectively all trade and financial 
dealings with Vietnam, and the Secretary of Commerce to exempt Vietnam 
from existing controls implementing the embargo. Vietnamese assets in 
the United States or within the possession or control of persons subject 
to U.S. jurisdiction and that are now blocked should remain blocked 
until further notice.
    In discharging these responsibilities, you are directed to consult 
with the heads of other Executive departments and agencies as may be 
appropriate.
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: This memorandum was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on February 4.
