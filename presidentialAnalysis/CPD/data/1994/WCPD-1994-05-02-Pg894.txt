Statement on the South African Elections

April 22, 1994

    The world is elated at the prospect of these elections. They are the 
next step in South Africa's historic path from apartheid to nonracial 
democracy. Americans have stood by South Africans in their struggle, and 
we will be steadfast in our commitment to work with all South Africans 
to build the prosperous, stable, and just society that can come in its 
place.

Note: This statement was included in a White House press release

of the Rainbow Coalition, to head the official delegation to observe the 
South African elections. Other members of the delegation were listed as 
follows: Dr. George Moose, Assistant Secretary of State for African 
Affairs; Reverend Dr. Charles Stith, president, National Organization 
for New Equality; Dr. Arthur Thomas, president of Central State (Ohio) 
University; Dr. Pauline Baker of the Aspen Institute; Mr. Dick J. 
Batchelor, chairman, Florida Environmental Regulation Commission; and
