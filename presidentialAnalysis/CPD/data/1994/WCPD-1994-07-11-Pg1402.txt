to debate on the Senate floor. His commitment to universal coverage has 
been clear throughout this process, and I look forward to his continued 
leadership as we move toward guaranteed health coverage for every 
American.
    I remain firmly committed to guaranteed health coverage for every 
American that can never be taken away. We must achieve universal 
coverage if we are to reform our health care system and assure hard-
working, middle class Americans that they will have health care when 
they need it. I am confident that we will achieve the goal of guaranteed 
coverage for everyone this year, and I look forward to the debate in the 
full House and Senate.
