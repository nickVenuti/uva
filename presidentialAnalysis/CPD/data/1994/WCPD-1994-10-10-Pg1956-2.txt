Statement on the ``Federal Mandate Relief for State and Local Government 
Act of 1994''

October 5, 1994

    I want to commend Chairman John Conyers and the House Government 
Operations Committee for adopting today the bipartisan ``Federal Mandate 
Relief for State and Local Government Act of 1994'' (H.R. 5128). This 
legislation, which I strongly support, will control the growth of 
Federal unfunded mandates and restore balance to the intergovernmental 
partnership between the Federal

Government and State, local, and tribal governments. I encourage the 
House of Representatives to act on this legislation expeditiously.
