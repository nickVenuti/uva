Supreme Court Justice Resignation

    Q. Mr. President, have you heard about Justice Blackmun's 
resignation tomorrow?
    The President. I can't comment on it. Let's let him speak for 
himself.
    Q. Have you spoken to him in the last two days?
    The President. I have not.
    Q. Have you got a short list, Mr. President?
    The President. Let Justice Blackmun speak for himself. I have not 
spoken to him. We have to let him speak for himself.
    Q. Has he written to you? Has he notified you?
    The President. No. I have not talked to him. I have not talked to 
him or, to the best of my knowledge, we have received no letter from 
him. Let's let him speak for himself--some communication with him 
tomorrow.
    Q. But given the recent shakeup at the White House, is the White 
House in a position to select a new Justice?
