Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 Statement on the Observance of Orthodox Christmas January 7, 2015 Michelle and I wish all Orthodox Christians in the United States and in the diverse Orthodox communities throughout the world a blessed and joyous Christmas. During this season of peace and fellowship, we have been saddened to see that, around the world, some Orthodox communities face difficult times and an uncertain future. We underscore the United States commitment to promoting the freedom of religion that is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that is the birthright of every person, everywhere. We join the Orthodox community this holiday season in celebration and in prayer for greater peace and justice throughout the world. Categories: Statements by the President : Orthodox Christmas.
