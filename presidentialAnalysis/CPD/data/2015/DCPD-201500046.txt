Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 Statement on the Death of King Abdallah bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia January 22, 2015 It is with deep respect that I express my personal condolences and the sympathies of the American people to the family of King Abdallah bin Abd al-Aziz and to the people of Saudi Arabia. King Abdallah's life spanned from before the birth of modern Saudi Arabia through its emergence as a critical force within the global economy and a leader among Arab and Islamic nations. He took bold steps in advancing the Arab Peace Initiative, an endeavor that will outlive him as an enduring contribution to the search for peace in the region. At home, King Abdallah's vision was dedicated to the education of his people and to greater engagement with the world. As our countries worked together to confront many challenges, I always valued King Abdallah's perspective and appreciated our genuine and warm friendship. As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions. One of those convictions was his steadfast and passionate belief in the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship as a force for stability and security in the Middle East and beyond. The closeness and strength of the partnership between our two countries is part of King Abdallah's legacy. May God grant him peace.
