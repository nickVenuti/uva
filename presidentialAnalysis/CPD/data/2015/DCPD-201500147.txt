Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation To Fund the Department of Homeland Security March 3, 2015 Every day, the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security work to secure our borders, respond to disasters, guard our coasts, protect our cybersecurity, and keep our ports and airports safe. They're law enforcement professionals and brave patriots who do a remarkable job and deserve our gratitude and respect. Today, after far too long, Congress finally voted to fully fund their mission.
