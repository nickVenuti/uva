Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 Statement on the Death of Former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam of India July 28, 2015 On behalf of the American people, I wish to extend my deepest condolences to the people of India on the passing of former Indian President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. A scientist and statesman, Dr. Kalam rose from humble beginnings to become one of India's most accomplished leaders, earning esteem at home and abroad. An advocate for stronger U.S.-India relations, Dr. Kalam worked to deepen our space cooperation, forging links with NASA during a 1962 visit to the United States. His tenure as India's 11th President witnessed unprecedented growth in U.S.-India ties. Suitably named the People's President, Dr. Kalam's humility and dedication to public service served as an inspiration to millions of Indians and admirers around the world.
