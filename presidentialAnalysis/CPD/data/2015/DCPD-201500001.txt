Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 Statement on the Death of Mario M. Cuomo January 1, 2015 Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo. An Italian Catholic kid from Queens, born to immigrant parents, Mario paired his faith in God and faith in America to live a life of public service, and we are all better for it. He rose to be chief executive of the State he loved, a determined champion of progressive values, and an unflinching voice for tolerance, inclusiveness, fairness, dignity, and opportunity. His own story taught him that as Americans, we are bound together as one people and our country's success rests on the success of all of us, not just a fortunate few. Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to Mario's wife Matilda; his children, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Maria, Margaret, Madeline, and Chris; and his family, friends, and New Yorkers who loved him dearly. NOTE: The statement referred to Maria Cuomo Cole, daughter of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Cuomo, Mario M.
