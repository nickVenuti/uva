Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 Statement on Representative Samuel S. Farr's Decision Not To Seek Reelection November 13, 2015 For more than 40 years, from his service on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors to his tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives, Sam Farr has worked tirelessly for the people of California. Sam has helped protect our oceans and our environment, remove trade barriers for Californian businesses, and promote travel and tourism throughout the United States.
