Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 Statement on the Death of Stuart O. Scott January 4, 2015 I will miss Stuart Scott. Twenty years ago, Stu helped usher in a new way to talk about our favorite teams and the day's best plays. For much of those 20 years, public service and campaigns have kept me from my family. But wherever I went, I could flip on the TV and Stu and his colleagues on SportsCenter were there. Over the years, he entertained us, and in the end, he inspired us with courage and love. Michelle and I offer our thoughts and prayers to his family, friends, and colleagues. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Scott, Stuart O. Names: Obama, Michelle; Scott, Stuart O.
