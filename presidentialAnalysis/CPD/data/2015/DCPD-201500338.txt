Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 Statement on the Death of Former Speaker of the House of Representatives James C. Wright, Jr. May 6, 2015 Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of former Congressman and Speaker of the House Jim Wright. Jim represented the people of his beloved Texas for over three decades. He was a committed public leader and a proud World War II veteran who dedicated much of his life to serving his country. As a Representative from Texas and Speaker of the House, Jim was passionate about investing in infrastructure, and he worked tirelessly to promote peace in Central America. Today our thoughts and prayers are with Jim's family and friends and the people he represented in Congress for so many years.
