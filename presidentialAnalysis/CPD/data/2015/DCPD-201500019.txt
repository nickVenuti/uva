Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 Statement on the Death of Andraé E. Crouch January 9, 2015 Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of music legend Pastor Andraé Crouch. Pastor Crouch grew up the son of a minister in California and discovered at a young age that he was blessed with extraordinary musical talent, which would lead to an iconic career that spanned over 50 years. As a leading pioneer of contemporary gospel music, the soulful classics that Pastor Crouch created over the years have uplifted the hearts and minds of several generations, and his timeless influence continues to be felt in not only gospel, but a variety of music genres. We are grateful that his music and spirit will continue to live on for years to come, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and fans during this time.
