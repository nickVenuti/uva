Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 Statement on the Death of Former Senator Edward W. Brooke III January 3, 2015 Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of former Senator Edward Brooke. Senator Brooke led an extraordinary life of public service, including his time in the U.S. Army. As the first African American elected as a State's attorney general and first African American U.S. Senator elected after reconstruction, Ed Brooke stood at the forefront of the battle for civil rights and economic fairness. During his time in elected office, he sought to build consensus and understanding across partisan lines, always working towards practical solutions to our Nation's challenges. We express our deepest sympathies to his wife Anne, children Remi, Edwina, Edward, stepdaughter Melanie, family, friends, and the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. NOTE: The statement referred to Remi C. Goldstone and Edwina H. Petit, daughters, and Melanie Laflamme, stepdaughter, of former Sen. Brooke.
