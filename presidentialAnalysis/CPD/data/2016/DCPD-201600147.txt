Administration of Barack Obama, 2016 Statement on Senate Confirmation of John B. King, Jr., as Secretary of Education March 14, 2016 I applaud the Senate for confirming John King as Secretary of Education. In this role, John will continue to lead our efforts to work toward high-quality preschool for all, prepare our kids for college and a career, make college more affordable, and protect Americans from the burdens of student debt. John knows how education can transform a child's future. He's seen it in his own life. And his experience, counsel, and leadership couldn't be more valuable to me and to our country as we work to open the doors of opportunity to all of America's children.
