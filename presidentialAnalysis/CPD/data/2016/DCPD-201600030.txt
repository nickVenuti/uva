Administration of Barack Obama, 2016 Statement on the 43d Anniversary of the Supreme Court Decision in Roe v. Wade January 22, 2016 Today we mark the 43rd anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, which affirmed a woman's freedom to make her own choices about her body and her health. The decision supports the broader principle that the government should not intrude on private decisions made between a woman and her doctor. As we commemorate this day, we also redouble our commitment to protecting these constitutional rights, including protecting a woman's access to safe, affordable health care and her right to reproductive freedom from efforts to undermine or overturn them. In America, every single one of us deserves the rights, freedoms, and opportunities to fulfill our dreams. Categories: Statements by the President : Roe v.
