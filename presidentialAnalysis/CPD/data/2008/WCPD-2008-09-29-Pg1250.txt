    President Bush. Mr. President, thank you.
    I want to let my friend know, and the people of El Salvador, that 
the United States will extend TPS status to El Salvadorians living in 
our country. This is a decision that was made to improve the lives of El 
Salvadorians.
    I'm proud to make this announcement with you standing by my side. 
You've been a very strong and courageous leader, and you have been a 
friend. And I know this is an issue of concern to you because you care 
deeply about the people of your country. And so when you get back home, 
you can tell the people that TPS has been extended.
    Thank you, sir.

    President Saca. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President, 
for extending for 18 months more the TPS for the people of El Salvador.
