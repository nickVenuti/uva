Statement on Senator Edward M. Kennedy

May 20, 2008

    Laura and I are concerned to learn of our friend Senator Kennedy's 
diagnosis. Ted Kennedy is a man of tremendous courage, remarkable 
strength, and powerful spirit. Our thoughts are with Senator Kennedy and 
his family during this difficult period. We join our fellow Americans in 
praying for his full recovery.
