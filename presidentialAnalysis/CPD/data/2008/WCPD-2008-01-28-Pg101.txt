Statement on Signing an Executive Order To Reform How the United States 
Reviews National Security Concerns That May Arise From Foreign 
Investments

January 23, 2008

    Today I issued an Executive order reforming how the United States 
reviews national security concerns that may arise from foreign 
investments, in light of the Foreign Investment and National Security 
Act of 2007. The Executive order furthers the goals of the new law by 
ensuring that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States 
will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by 
certain foreign investments into the United States. The Executive order 
reaffirms our commitment to open economies and our policy of welcoming 
foreign investment and the important economic benefits that such 
investment brings. At the same time, the Executive order sets forth 
procedures for protecting our national security, recognizing that our 
openness is vital to our prosperity and security.

Note: The statement referred to Executive Order 13456.
