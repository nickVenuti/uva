Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Dmitry A. Medvedev of Russia 
in Lima

November 22, 2008

    President Bush. It's an interesting moment because I've had a lot of 
meetings with Dmitry and Vladimir Putin. This will be my last meeting as 
the sitting President with the leader of Russia. We've had our 
agreements; we've had our disagreements. I've tried to work hard to make 
it a cordial relationship, though, so that when we need to work together 
we can, and when we disagree we're able to do so in a way that is 
respectful to our two nations.
    I thank you for coming by today and appreciate your time.
    President Medvedev. Thank you very much, George. And in general, 
though we do have points of agreement and those points of real 
differences, positions, we are prepared for the continuous work. And I 
view that, in general, our work was successful.
