Statement on the Anniversary of the Virginia Tech Shootings in 
Blacksburg, Virginia

April 15, 2008

    April 16, 2007, brought the deadliest day of violence on a college 
campus in our Nation's history. The horrific crimes committed at 
Virginia Tech University filled our souls with sadness. One year later, 
we remember the victims murdered and wounded that day.
    We join our fellow Americans in praying for the families and friends 
whose hearts ache for their lost loved ones. We continue to be amazed by 
the extraordinary Hokie spirit and inspired by the survivors of this 
tragedy. Students, teachers, and alumni have overcome evil with good by 
supporting each other with love and compassion. We are humbled by their 
resilience and confident in the university's bright future.
    We pray that God will continue to comfort and heal the people of the 
Virginia Tech community.
