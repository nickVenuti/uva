Statement on the 175th Anniversary of Thailand-United States Relations

March 19, 2008

    Laura and I join in celebrating the 175th anniversary of relations 
between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Thailand. The 
United States and Thailand have long been linked by bonds of trust, 
appreciation, and friendship. The Treaty of Amity and Commerce, signed 
on March 20, 1833, solidified our commitment to working together for 
mutual benefit and marked the first agreement of its kind between the 
United States and an Asian nation. Over the past 175 years, our two 
governments have worked together on issues such as economic development, 
health care, and security. Today, we share a commitment to democracy and 
to free and fair trade, as well as a respect for human rights. Our 
tradition of cooperation and support remains strong.
    I thank His Majesty the King and the citizens of Thailand for our 
enduring partnership. This anniversary is an opportunity to underscore 
our shared ideal of liberty and reinforce our bonds of friendship and 
understanding. We are proud to celebrate this historic day.

Note: The statement referred to King Phumiphon Adunyadet of Thailand.
