Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa 2008

December 24, 2008

    I send greetings to those observing Kwanzaa.
    Kwanzaa is the celebration of African culture, community, and family 
traditions. For more than 40 years, millions of people have come 
together to reaffirm Nguzo Saba, the Seven Principles of Kwanzaa. These 
principles emphasize unity, self-determination, collective work and 
responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith.
    As people across our country gather to commemorate this seven-day 
celebration, may we all be reminded that Kwanzaa is an opportunity to 
celebrate the many contributions of our African American citizens.
    Laura and I send our best wishes for a joyous Kwanzaa.
                                                George W. Bush
