Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Jerusalem

March 6, 2008

    I condemn in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attack in 
Jerusalem that targeted innocent students at the Mercaz Harav Yeshiva. 
This barbaric and vicious attack on innocent civilians deserves the 
condemnation of every nation.
    I have just spoken with Prime Minister Olmert to extend my deepest 
condolences to the victims, their families, and to the people of Israel. 
I told him the United States stands firmly with Israel in the face of 
this terrible attack.
