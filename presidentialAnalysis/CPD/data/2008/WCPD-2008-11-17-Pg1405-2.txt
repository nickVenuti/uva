    Admiral, thank you very much for leading an amazing group of men and 
women who

provide such compassion and skill for those who have been wounded.
    You know, I'm--appreciate the families who were so gracious to me 
here. One of the things I tell them is that their loved one is going to 
get fabulous medical care, and they do. It's inspiring to see the hard 
work. It's also inspiring to see the courage of the patients. I met some 
of the men that I'd seen 6 months ago; I came back, and they're totally 
different looking people. That's because of the good health care. It's 
also because of their mental framework. They've decided that nothing's 
going to get them down, and they battled back. And they're--a lot of 
them are doing really well.
    So I want to thank you for your time, and it's been an honor to be 
the Commander in Chief of such fine men and women.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:19 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Rear Adm. Matthew L. Nathan, USN, commander, National Naval Medical 
Center.
