Message on the Observance of Cinco de Mayo, 2008

May 2, 2008

    I send greetings to those celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
    Cinco de Mayo is a joyful day in Mexican history and an important 
milestone in the history of freedom. On May 5, 1862, an outnumbered band 
of Mexican soldiers defeated a large European power against overwhelming 
odds at the Battle of Puebla. Emboldened by victory and yearning for 
independence, Mexican patriots ultimately won independence on September 
16, 1867. Today, we remember these heroic accomplishments and all those 
working to advance peace and liberty around the globe.
    This holiday is also an opportunity to recognize the strong ties of 
family, economy, and culture that bind the United States and Mexico. 
Through a shared commitment to economic liberty and the universal right 
of freedom, the United States and Mexico continue to build a future of 
prosperity and opportunity for all people.
    Laura and I send our best wishes. Que Dios los bendiga.
                                                George W. Bush
