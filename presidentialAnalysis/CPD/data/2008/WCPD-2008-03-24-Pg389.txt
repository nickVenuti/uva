Message on the Observance of Saint Patrick's Day, 2008

March 14, 2008

    I send greetings to those celebrating St. Patrick's Day.
    On this day, we commemorate the great faith of St. Patrick and 
celebrate the rich heritage of the Irish people. The Apostle of Ireland 
was committed to preaching a gospel of peace even in the face of great 
hardship, and people of all faiths can be inspired by his remarkable 
example. During St. Patrick's Day, we join together with the many 
children of Erin who have come to our shores full of hope and purpose, 
and found success.
    Americans are grateful for our country's Irish traditions and the 
deep friendship that exists between Ireland and the United States. Irish 
Americans have valiantly defended our Nation, enriched our culture, and 
contributed to our prosperity. We are reminded, in celebrating, of our 
history as a Nation of immigrants and of our responsibility to remain a 
welcoming society.
    Laura and I send our best wishes for a blessed and joyous St. 
Patrick's Day.
                                                George W. Bush
