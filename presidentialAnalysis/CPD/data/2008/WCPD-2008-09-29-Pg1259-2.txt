Remarks on the National Economy

September 26, 2008

    Good morning. My administration continues to work with the Congress 
on a rescue plan. And we need a rescue plan. This is--it's hard work. 
Our proposal is a big proposal, and the reason it's big and substantial 
is because we got a big problem.
    We also need to move quickly. Now, any time you have a plan this 
big, that is moving this quickly, that requires legislative approval, it 
creates challenges. Members want to be heard. They want to be able to 
express their opinions, and they should be allowed to express their 
opinions.
    There are disagreements over aspects of the rescue plan, but there 
is no disagreement that something substantial must be done. The 
legislative process is sometimes not very pretty, but we are going to 
get a package passed. We will rise to the occasion. Republicans and 
Democrats will come together and pass a substantial rescue plan.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 9:40 a.m. on the Colonnade at the White 
House. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish 
language transcript of these remarks.
