Statement on the Death of Charlton Heston

April 6, 2008

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of our friend Charlton Heston. 
Charlton Heston was one of the most successful actors in movie history 
and a strong advocate for liberty.
    Widely acclaimed for his long, award-winning film career, he also 
had a profound impact off the screen. He served his country during World 
War II, marched in the civil rights movement, led a labor union, and 
vigorously defended Americans' second amendment rights. He was a man of 
character and integrity, with a big heart. For all these reasons, in 
2003, I was proud to award Charlton Heston the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom, the Nations's highest civil honor.
    Our prayers are with his wife, Lydia, and the entire Heston family 
during this difficult time.
