Remarks Following a Visit to the Treasury Department

October 3, 2008

    The President. I just had the honor of talking to Treasury 
Department employees. I thanked them for their hard work over the past 6 
weeks in dealing with a serious financial crisis.
    I do want to thank the Secretary too. Mr. Secretary, you and your 
team have worked incredibly hard. You've worked with the Congress; 
you've worked with the financial markets, both domestically and 
internationally. I know that your people are exhausted in there, and 
I'm--really appreciate the fact that I'm going to sign a piece of 
legislation that'll be a part of solving this crisis, an important part 
of solving the crisis.
    And so I just went up to thank people. Sometimes people in 
government never get thanked enough for all the hours they keep. And 
I've got a lot of confidence in you, Mr. Secretary, and your team. And I 
want to thank you for giving me a chance to come by, and looking forward 
to getting this plan in place. I just told the people in the Rose Garden 
that, you know, it's complicated, and we're going to make sure that 
whatever we do is done in a deliberate fashion, and one that will be 
effective and be mindful of the taxpayers. Appreciate serving with you.
    Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. Thank you very much.
    The President. Appreciate serving with you. Thank you all.

H.R. 1424, approved October 3, which was assigned Public Law No. 110-
