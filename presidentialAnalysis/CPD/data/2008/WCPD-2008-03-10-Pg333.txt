Remarks Following a Meeting With Frank W. Buckles

March 6, 2008

    Sitting next to me is Mr. Frank Buckles, 107 years young, and he is 
the last living doughboy from World War I. And it has been my high honor 
to welcome Mr. Buckles and his daughter, Susannah, here to the Oval 
Office.
    Mr. Buckles's mind is sharp; his memory is crisp; and he's been 
sharing with me some interesting anecdotes. I asked him where he lived, 
and he said, ``That reminds me of what General Pershing asked me.'' And 
he told the general that he was raised on a farm in Missouri. And the 
general said, ``Well, you know, as the crow flies, it's 40 miles from 
where I was raised.'' So Mr. Buckles has a vivid recollection of 
historic times.
    And one way for me to honor the service of those who wear the 
uniform in the past and those who wear it today is to herald you, sir, 
and to thank you very much for your patriotism and your love for 
America.
    So we're glad you're here. Thanks for coming.

Note: The President spoke at 11:49 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House.
