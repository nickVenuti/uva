Statement on Senate Confirmation of Steven C. Preston as Secretary of 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development

June 5, 2008

    I am pleased that the Senate unanimously confirmed Steve Preston to 
serve as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
    Steve is a strong leader whose understanding of our financial 
markets and strong management skills make him highly qualified to serve 
in this important position. He will aggressively work to ensure that the 
Department remains focused on its mission of making housing more 
affordable and helping Americans keep their homes. Steve is also a 
consensus-builder who will build on our efforts to work with Congress on 
responsible legislation addressing our Nation's housing policies.
