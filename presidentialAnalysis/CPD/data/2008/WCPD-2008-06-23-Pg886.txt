Message on the Observance of Juneteenth

June 19, 2008

    I send greetings to those celebrating Juneteenth.
    On Juneteenth, we commemorate the arrival of Major General Gordon 
Granger in Galveston, Texas, and his declaration that slavery had been 
abolished and the blessings of liberty were finally extended to African 
Americans.
    On this occasion, we recognize the many contributions that African 
Americans have made to our great Nation and honor the legacy of 
diversity that America has embraced. Today is an opportunity to recommit 
ourselves to confronting injustice wherever we find it and upholding the 
dignity of all people. By doing so, we protect the freedom and 
democratic ideals that will keep America strong for generations to come.
    Laura and I send our best wishes on this memorable occasion.
                                                George W. Bush
