Statement on the Earthquake in China

May 12, 2008

    I extend my condolences to those injured and to the families of the 
victims of today's earthquake in China's Sichuan Province. I am 
particularly saddened by the number of students and children affected by 
this tragedy. The thoughts and prayers of the American people are with 
the Chinese people, especially those directly affected. The United 
States stands ready to help in any way possible.
