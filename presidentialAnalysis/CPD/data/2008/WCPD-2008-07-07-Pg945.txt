Rescue of Hostages in Colombia

    Yesterday, I had the opportunity to speak to President Uribe of 
Colombia. And he called to give me the good news that hostages had been 
rescued, including three Americans that had been held since 2003. I 
congratulated the President. I asked him to congratulate his military 
and those who had planned it. And I told him what a joyous occasion it 
must be to know that the plan had worked, that people who were unjustly 
held are now free to be with their families.
    And so I'm proud of our relationship with Colombia, and I'm proud of 
my friend President Uribe. And I appreciate his courage and his strong 
leadership and the successful operations they waged.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 11:56 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and Keith Stansell, former hostages held 
by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC).
