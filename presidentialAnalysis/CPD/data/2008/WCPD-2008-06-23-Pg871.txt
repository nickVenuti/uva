true commitment to defeat this threat to our peace and security.
    The Russian Federation and the United States launched the Global 
Initiative on July 15, 2006 and we can now call more than 70 nations 
Global Initiative partners. We will continue to stand upon the 
principles at the heart of this Initiative, attract others to our ranks 
and realize our goal of making this a truly global effort. Gathering as 
partners in Madrid is an important reminder to one another of the 
commitments we have to each of our citizens to see clearly the concrete 
steps we can take together to prevent nuclear terrorism and ensure our 
peace and security.
