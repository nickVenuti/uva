Statement on the Situation in Georgia

August 25, 2008

    I am deeply concerned by today's appeal to President Medvedev by 
Russia's Federation Council and Duma, the upper and lower Houses of 
Russia's Parliament, to recognize the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia as independent countries. I call on Russia's leadership to 
meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions.
    Georgia's territorial integrity and borders must command the same

other nation's, including Russia's. Russia agreed, when President 
Medvedev signed the French-brokered cease-fire agreement, to the opening 
of international discussions on security and stability modalities in 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This represents an internationally endorsed 
approach to these issues, which recognition would undercut. Recognition 
would also be inconsistent with unanimously approved United Nations 
Security resolutions that Russia has consistently voted for in the past.
    The United States will continue to stand with the people of Georgia 
and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial 
integrity.

Note: The statement referred to President Dmitry A. Medvedev of Russia.
