Remarks Following a Meeting With the Chicago 2016 Bid Committee and 
United States Olympic Committee Members in Chicago

January 7, 2008

    I want to thank the members of the 2016 Chicago bid to get the 
Olympics. Listen, Mr. Mayor, you and your committee have put together a 
great plan. It's a plan that will make America proud.
    They say that the Olympics will come to Chicago if we're fortunate 
enough to be selected, but really it's coming to America. And I can't 
think of a better city to represent the United States than Chicago.
    This is a well-thought-out venue. There will be--the athletes will 
be taken care of. People who will be coming from around the world will 
find that this good city has got fantastic accommodations and great 
restaurants. It will be safe.
    And so I--this country supports your bid strongly. And our hope is 
that the judges will take a good look at Chicago and select Chicago for 
the 2016 Olympics.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 11:35 a.m. at the Union League Club of 
Chicago. In his remarks, he referred to Mayor Richard M. Daley of 
Chicago, IL.
