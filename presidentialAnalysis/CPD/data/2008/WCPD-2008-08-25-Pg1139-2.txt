Statement on the Death of President Levy Patrick Mwanawasa of Zambia

August 19, 2008

    Laura and I are saddened to hear of the passing of Zambian President 
Levy Mwanawasa. President Mwanawasa was a champion of democracy in his 
own country and throughout Africa. As President of Zambia, President 
Mwanawasa launched a sweeping anticorruption campaign and dedicated 
himself to improving the welfare of all Zambians. As Chairman of the 
Southern African Development Community, President Mwanawasa worked 
tirelessly to uphold the values of good governance, speaking out against 
human rights abuses and threats to democracy when many others were 
silent.
    On behalf of the United States, we extend our sincere condolences to 
President Mwanawasa's wife, his family, and all Zambians during this 
difficult time.
