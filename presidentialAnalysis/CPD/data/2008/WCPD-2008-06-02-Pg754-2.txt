Statement on the Presidential Election in Lebanon

May 25, 2008

    I congratulate Michel Sleiman on his election as President of 
Lebanon. I am confident that Lebanon has chosen a leader committed to 
protecting its sovereignty, extending the Government's authority over 
all of Lebanon, and upholding Lebanon's international obligations under 
U.N. Security Council resolutions, including 1559, 1701, and 1757.
    I am hopeful that the Doha agreement, which paved the way for this 
election, will usher in an era of political reconciliation to the 
benefit of all Lebanese. We look forward to working with President 
Sleiman in pursuit of our common values of freedom and independence.
