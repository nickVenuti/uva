Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Mumbai, India

November 28, 2008

    Laura and I are deeply saddened that at least two Americans were 
killed and others injured in Wednesday's horrific attack in Mumbai. We 
also mourn the great loss of life suffered by so many people from 
several other countries, and we have the wounded in our thoughts and 
prayers.
    My administration has been working with the Indian Government and 
the international community as Indian authorities work to ensure the 
safety of those still under threat. We will continue to cooperate 
against these extremists who offer nothing but violence and 
hopelessness.
