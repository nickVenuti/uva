Message on the Observance of Eid al-Adha

December 8, 2008

    I send greetings to Muslims around the world celebrating Eid al-
Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice.
    Eid al-Adha commemorates Abraham's devotion to God, and it reminds 
us of God's mercy and provision for his people. Abraham's deep faith was 
tested when God asked

him to sacrifice his son. Although Abraham was set to faithfully obey, 
God provided an alternate sacrifice that spared his son. During this 
holiday, Muslims around the world honor Abraham's trust in God and 
celebrate God's love through acts of charity and joyous feasts with 
family, friends, and others in their community.
    Our Nation is blessed by vibrant Muslim communities. On this 
holiday, all Americans celebrate our religious liberty, and we remember 
that religious freedom belongs not to any one nation but to the world.
    Laura and I send our best wishes for a blessed holiday.
                                                George W. Bush
