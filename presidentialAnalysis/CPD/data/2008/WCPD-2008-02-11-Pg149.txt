Dear Madam Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Consistent with the authorities relating to official immunity in the 
interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking (Public Law 
107-108, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2291-4), and in order to keep the 
Congress fully informed, I am providing a report prepared by my 
Administration. This report includes matters relating to the 
interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. This
