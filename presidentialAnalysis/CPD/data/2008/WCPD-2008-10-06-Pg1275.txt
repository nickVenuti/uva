Statement on House of Representatives Passage of India-United States 
Nuclear Cooperation and Nonproliferation Legislation

September 27, 2008

    I congratulate the House of Representatives for passing H.R. 7081, 
the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and 
Nonproliferation Enhancement Act. The passage of this legislation by the 
House is another major step forward in achieving the transformation of 
the U.S.-India relationship.
    I thank the Members of Congress who helped to pass this legislation, 
especially House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman (D-CA) 
and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL). In addition, I would like 
to recognize the contributions of two great Americans and legislators, 
Congressmen Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde, who saw early on the importance 
of a strategic partnership with India and of bringing the people of our 
two great nations together through this initiative.
    I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this important piece 
of legislation before their October adjournment. Signing this bipartisan 
bill will help strengthen our partnership with India.
