Statement on Senate Passage of India-United States Nuclear Cooperation 
and Nonproliferation Legislation

October 1, 2008

    I congratulate the Senate on passing the United States-India Nuclear 
Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act, H.R. 7081. In 
particular, I commend the members of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee for their leadership in crafting this important bipartisan 
legislation. I also thank Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader 
McConnell for bringing this bill to a vote prior to the Senate's 
adjournment. This legislation will strengthen our global nuclear 
nonproliferation efforts, protect the environment, create jobs, and 
assist India in meeting its growing energy needs in a responsible 
manner.
    I look forward to signing this bill into law and continuing to 
strengthen the U.S.-India strategic partnership.
