Message on the Observance of Labor Day

August 29, 2008

    I send greetings to all Americans celebrating Labor Day 2008.
    In America, all citizens have an opportunity to forge their own 
paths forward, and their success is limited only by the size of their 
dreams. From engineering to healthcare and from small businesses to 
education, the American people are the most industrious, enterprising, 
and productive in the world. These talented and innovative workers 
provide for their families and play a vital role in building a more 
prosperous future for our country. By trusting in the ingenuity and 
creativity of America's risk-takers and dreamers, our country will 
remain the most vibrant, hopeful, and dynamic around the globe.
    Each year on Labor Day, we honor the dedicated men and women of our 
Nation's workforce. Their determined efforts add to the strength and 
vitality of our country and build a brighter future for America.
    Laura and I send our best wishes.
                                                George W. Bush
