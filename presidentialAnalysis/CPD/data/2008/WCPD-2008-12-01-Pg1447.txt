Message on the Fifth Anniversary of the Rose Revolution

November 21, 2008

    I send greetings to those celebrating the fifth anniversary of the 
Rose Revolution.
    One of the most inspiring chapters in the history of freedom was 
written by the Georgian people during the Rose Revolution. Thirsting for 
liberty and armed only with roses in hand, citizens throughout Georgia 
peacefully staked claim to their God-given right of liberty. These 
demonstrations proved once again, that when given a choice, people 
choose to live in freedom.
    On this anniversary, Americans honor the brave Georgian citizens who 
defended freedom, and we renew our commitment to supporting Georgia's 
democracy, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. We also 
look forward to the day when the light of liberty shines on all people 
throughout the world.
    Laura and I send our best wishes. May the God who gave us liberty 
bless those who are advancing freedom's cause.
                                                George W. Bush
