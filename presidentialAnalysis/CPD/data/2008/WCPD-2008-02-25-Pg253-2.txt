Remarks During a Lunch With Peace Corps Volunteers in Accra

February 20, 2008

    Ambassador, thank you very much for setting up this lunch. Laura and 
I and Condi are thrilled to be with some of our most notable citizens. 
These are folks who have left the comfort of America to join the Peace 
Corps to serve humanity, and we're really looking forward to hearing 
your stories and hearing what life is like.
    One of the things I tell our country all the time is our great 
strength lies in the hearts and souls of our citizens. And I don't think 
there's any more giving people than the Peace Corps volunteers. And so, 
Robert, thank you very much for joining us and bringing along some of 
the--our fellow citizens who are making a huge difference in people's 
lives.
    I'm sure you would like to share a few remarks.

[At this point, the discussion continued, and no transcript was
