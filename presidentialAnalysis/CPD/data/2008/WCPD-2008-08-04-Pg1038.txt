Remarks on Signing the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE (Junta's Anti-
Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008 and the Renewal of Import Restrictions 
Contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003

July 29, 2008

    Laura and I are welcome--are pleased to welcome members of the 
Lantos family. Mrs. Lantos, thanks for joining us; and Members of 
Congress who care deeply about democracy in Burma. I'm going to sign a 
piece of legislation and a joint resolution that will continue some 
sanctions, impose new sanctions, and extend import restrictions. On the 
Burmese regime, our message is: The United States believes in democracy 
and freedom.
    Not only will I sign the joint resolution, I'm also looking forward 
to signing the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008.
    Thank you all for joining us. Thank you for your caring.

Note: The President spoke at 10:30 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Annette Lantos, widow of Rep. 
Thomas P. Lantos, who passed away on February 11, 2008. H.R. 3890, 
approved July 29, was assigned Public Law No. 110-286; H.J. Res. 93, 
also approved July 29, was assigned Public Law No. 110-287.
