Letter to Congressional Leaders Extending Generalized System of 
Preferences Benefits to Kosovo and Azerbaijan

December 19, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    In accordance with section 502(f)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (the ``1974 Act''), I am notifying the Congress of

[[Page 1574]]

my intent to add the Republic of Kosovo (Kosovo) and the Republic of 
Azerbaijan (Azerbaijan) to the list of beneficiary developing countries 
under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program.
    In Proclamation 8272 of June 30, 2008, I designated Serbia as a 
beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP program. On 
February 17, 2008, Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia. 
Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and having considered the 
factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, and in 
light of Kosovo's independence from Serbia, I have determined that 
Kosovo should be designated as a separate GSP beneficiary developing 
country.
    In addition, having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 
and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Azerbaijan should be 
designated as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP 
program.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate.
