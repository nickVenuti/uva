Statement on the Situation in Georgia

August 26, 2008

    The United States condemns the decision by the Russian President to 
recognize as independent states the Georgian regions of South Ossetia 
and Abkhazia. This decision is inconsistent with numerous United Nations 
Security Council resolutions that Russia has voted for in the past, and 
is also inconsistent with the French-brokered six-point cease-fire 
agreement which President Medvedev signed on August 12 [16] *, 2008. The 
six-point agreement offered a peaceful way forward to resolve the 
conflict. We expect Russia to live up to its international commitments, 
reconsider this irresponsible decision, and follow the approach set out 
in the six-point agreement.
    * White House correction.
    The territorial integrity and borders of Georgia must be respected, 
just as those of Russia or any other country. Russia's action only 
exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations. In 
accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions that remain 
in force, Abkhazia and South Ossetia are within the internationally 
recognized borders of Georgia, and they must remain so.

Note: The statement referred to President Dmitry A. Medvedev of Russia. 
The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
