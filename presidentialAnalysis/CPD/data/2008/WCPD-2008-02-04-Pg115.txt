Statement on the Death of Archbishop of Athens and All Greece 
Christodoulos

January 28, 2008

    Laura and I offer our condolences to the people of Greece at this 
time of mourning for the death of the Archbishop of Athens and all 
Greece Christodoulos. The late Archbishop was well-known as an 
articulate voice of the Orthodox faith, for his engagement in 
interreligious dialog, and for his promotion of social programs to help 
the vulnerable. Our prayers are with the people of Greece and all those 
who followed his spiritual guidance.
