Interview With Sam Ryan of CBS Sports in Philadelphia

December 6, 2008

Army-Navy Football Game

    Mr. Ryan. Mr. President, we know this is one of the most storied 
rivalries in all of sports. What does the Army-Navy game mean to you?
    The President. Well, it means to me that I have--I got a chance to 
come and be with people who will be joining the finest military in the 
history of the world.

Members of the U.S. Armed Forces

    Mr. Ryan. When you look at these young players and the seniors, and 
you know that they enrolled in the academies after 9/11, what does that 
say about them?
    The President. I stand in awe of somebody who would volunteer to 
serve America in a time of danger. It says that we are blessed to have 
people of such character in our country.

The Presidency

    Mr. Ryan. Mr. President, I know you're probably doing a lot of 
reflecting here on December 6th. What will you miss the most about being 
President?
    The President. I will miss a lot of things. But one of the things I 
have treasured the most is to be the Commander in Chief of men and women 
of courage and character and decency.
    Mr. Ryan. Thank you, Mr. President.
