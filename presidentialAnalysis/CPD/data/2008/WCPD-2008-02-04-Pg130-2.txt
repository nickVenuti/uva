Statement on the Death of Margaret Truman Daniel

January 29, 2008

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Margaret Truman Daniel. The 
only child of our 33d President, she supported her father as he 
confronted the difficult challenges of his Presidency, witnessing 
firsthand the leadership of Harry Truman in both war and peace. An 
accomplished author and singer, her life was one of tremendous personal 
achievement. Our thoughts and prayers are with Margaret Truman Daniel's 
sons and the rest of the Truman family.
