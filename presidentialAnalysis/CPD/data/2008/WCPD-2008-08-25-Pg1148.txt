Statement on the Death of Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones

August 20, 2008

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Chairwoman Stephanie Tubbs 
Jones.
    As a proud lifelong resident of Ohio's 11th District, she devoted 
her career to serving her community at both the State and national 
levels. She was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping 
small businesses, improving local schools, expanding job opportunities 
for Ohioans, and ensuring that more of them have access to healthcare. 
After making history as the first African American woman elected to 
Congress from Ohio, the Congresswoman worked to expand the rights of all 
Americans. Our Nation is grateful for her service.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with her son Mervyn Leroy Jones II and 
the rest of her family.
