Statement on the Situation in Zimbabwe

June 2, 2008

    The continued use of Government-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe, 
including unwarranted arrests and intimidation of opposition figures, to 
prevent the Movement for Democratic Change from campaigning freely ahead 
of the June 27 Presidential runoff election is deplorable. We call on 
the regime to immediately halt all attacks and to permit freedom of 
assembly, freedom of speech, and access to the media. We urge the 
Southern African Development Community, the African Union, the United 
Nations, and other international organizations to blanket the country 
with election and human rights monitors immediately.
    We also are concerned by reports that misguided Government policies 
are projected to result in one of the worst crop harvests in Zimbabwean 
history. While Robert Mugabe

makes political statements in Rome, his people continue to face empty 
markets at home. The United States currently feeds more than 1 million 
Zimbabweans and spent more than $170 million on food assistance in 
Zimbabwe last year. We will continue these efforts to prevent 
Government-induced starvation in Zimbabwe.

Note: The statement referred to President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
