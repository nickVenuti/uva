Dear Madam Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, consistent with the 
provisions of section 699M of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008

Nuclear Threat Reduction and Security Plan.''
    This report, compiled by the Departments of State, Defense, Energy,

and weapons-usable material at vulnerable sites are secure from 
terrorist threats. As required, the report includes information on 
sustainability plans, interagency cooperation, programmatic and 
budgetary requirements, and international engagement related to these 
vital national security efforts.
     Sincerely,
                                                George W. Bush
