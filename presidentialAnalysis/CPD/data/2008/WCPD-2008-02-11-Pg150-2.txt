Remarks Honoring the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Champion

February 5, 2008

    The President. You know, one of the things I love about NASCAR is 
not only are these great athletes, but they're socially minded folks. 
And Chandra and Jimmie and I met several times--one time at a place 
where the folks of NASCAR are putting something back into the community 
to help the less fortunate. In this case, it happened to be in a place 
called Victory Junction in North Carolina, and it was a fabulous 
experience. And I want to thank you all very much for taking your fame 
and lending it to help somebody in need. It's really what makes America 
a great place. And you're leaders on the track and leaders off the 
track.
    Jimmie Johnson. Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 1:09 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson and 
his wife, Chandra.
