Statement on the Resignation of Alphonso R. Jackson as Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development

March 31, 2008

    Today Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson 
announced his decision to leave the Department after 7 years of 
dedicated service. I have known Alphonso Jackson for many years, and I 
have known him to be a strong leader and a good man. I have accepted his 
resignation with regret.
    Secretary Jackson is a great American success story. The youngest of 
12 children--his father was a foundry worker, and his mother was a nurse 
midwife--Alphonso has always understood the value of hard work and equal 
opportunity for all Americans.
    For more than three decades, he has worked to help more Americans 
become homeowners and strengthen communities throughout our Nation. 
While leading the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Alphonso 
made significant progress in transforming public housing, revitalizing 
and modernizing the Federal Housing Administration, increasing 
affordable housing, rebuilding the gulf coast, decreasing homelessness, 
and increasing minority homeownership.
    Laura and I treasure our strong friendship with Secretary Jackson, 
his wife, Marcia, their daughters, Annette and Lesley, and their 
granddaughter, Lauren. We wish them all the best.
