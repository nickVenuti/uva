Remarks Following a Visit to the Beijing Kuanjie Protestant Christian 
Church in Beijing

August 10, 2008

    You know, I've just--Laura and I just had the great joy and 
privilege of worshiping here in Beijing, China. You know, it just goes 
to show that God is universal, and God is love, and no state, man, or 
woman should fear the influence of loving religion.
    And I want to thank the pastor for his hospitality. And I want to 
thank this beautiful choir for singing ``Amazing Grace'' and 
``Edelweiss.'' It was a touching moment. It's been a joy to worship 
here. Again, I want to thank you, sir, and God bless you. God bless you.

Note: The President spoke at 9:07 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Pastor Li Jian'an, senior pastor, Beijing Kuanjie Protestant Christian 
Church.
