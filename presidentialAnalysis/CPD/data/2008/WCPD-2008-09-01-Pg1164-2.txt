Message on the Observance of Ramadan

August 29, 2008

    I send greetings to Muslims observing Ramadan in America and around 
the globe.
    The holy month of Ramadan is a special time of prayer, fasting, and 
service. For Muslims, these days commemorate the revelation of God's 
word to the prophet Muhammad in the form of the Qur'an.
    I thank the men and women of the Muslim community for their 
contributions to America. Your love of family, and gratitude to God have 
strengthened the moral fabric of our country. Our Nation is stronger and 
more hopeful because of the generosity, talents, and compassion of our 
Muslim citizens.
    Laura and I send our best wishes. Ramadan Mubarak.
                                                George W. Bush
