Remarks on Arrival in Monrovia, Liberia

February 21, 2008

    President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia. Let me say how pleased 
we are to welcome President Bush, Mrs. Bush, Secretary Rice, and all the 
members of this delegation. It is a great honor for Liberia to receive 
them. And they've received a very warm welcome from the Liberian people, 
from our young people, from our students, who lined the route and waved 
and showed flags. We're just so pleased and honored. Thank you, 
President Bush, for making this trip.
    President Bush. Madam President, thanks. I've been looking forward 
to coming here ever since you extended the kind invitation to me. I do 
want to thank the people of Liberia for the warm welcome that we have 
received. I loved all the smiles and the enthusiasm along the route.
    Most importantly, I want the people of Liberia to know, Madam 
President, the United States stands with you. We want to help you 
recover from a terrible period. We want you

to build lives of hope and peace. And under your leadership, that's 
exactly what's happening. It is my honor to have presented you with the 
National Medal of Freedom. It's the highest civilian award a President 
can give, and I did so because of your courage and your leadership. And 
we are so excited to be with you.

    Thank you.

    President Johnson Sirleaf. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:23 a.m. at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.
