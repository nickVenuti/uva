    The President. Thank you, sir. I'm proud to be with you. Your 
Highness, thank you very much. I appreciate you picking this particular 
location. It is a fantastic view of your--of Dubai.

    First of all, just a couple of impressions--I'm most impressed with 
what I've seen here. The entrepreneurial spirit is strong and, equally 
importantly, the desire to make sure that all aspects of society are--
have hope and encouragement. And I appreciate your leadership, Your 
Highness.

    And I want to thank you, sir, for having me. I'm looking forward to 
talking to the young leaders from around the region. I will answer your 
questions. And I also want you to understand something about America: 
that we respect you; we respect your religion; and we want to work 
together for the sake of freedom and peace.

    And I thank--I'm particularly pleased to know that you have set up 
interchanges with some of the young in my country. You'll find them to 
be compassionate, decent people who share the same goals and dreams. And 
so I want to thank you for coming.

    Your Highness, I'm so honored by your hospitality.

    Ruler of Dubai Sheikh Muhammad bin Rashid al-Maktum. Thank you, sir. 
It is our pleasure to have you.

    The President. Thank you, sir.
