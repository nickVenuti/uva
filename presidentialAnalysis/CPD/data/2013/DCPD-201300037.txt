Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on the Resignation of Ronald Kirk as United States Trade Representative January 22, 2013 I want to thank Ambassador Kirk for his hard work on behalf of the American people over the past 4 years. There's no question Ron delivered results for the American people and for our economy. From bringing home new trade agreements with Korea, Colombia, and Panama and negotiating to open up new markets for American businesses, to cracking down on unfair trade practices around the world, he has been a tremendous advocate for the American worker. As a former mayor, Ron was relentless in making the case to the American public that a balanced, thoughtful trade policy can contribute to a stronger economic future for America. I appreciate his service and wish him the best of luck. Categories: Resignations and Retirements : U.S. Trade Representative, resignation, statement. Names: Kirk, Ronald.
