Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on the Death of Former Representative William H. Gray III July 2, 2013 Bill Gray was a trailblazer, proudly representing his beloved Philadelphia in Congress for over a decade as the first African American to chair the Budget Committee and to serve as the Majority Whip. Bill's extraordinary leadership, on issues from housing to transportation, to supporting efforts that ended Apartheid in South Africa, made our communities, our country, and our world a more just place. Michelle and I extend our deepest sympathies to Bill's family, especially to his wife Andrea and their three sons. NOTE: The statement referred to Andrew D. Gray, Justin Y. Gray, and William H.
