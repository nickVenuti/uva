Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on the Investiture of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands April 30, 2013 On behalf of the American people, Michelle and I congratulate His Majesty Willem-Alexander on the occasion of his investiture as King of the Netherlands, and we wish the very best to him and Queen Maxima as they assume their new roles. Our two nations share a rich history and strong ties, and we enjoyed hosting the royal couple at the White House in September 2009, when they visited the United States to mark the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's historic voyage. We also send our heartfelt appreciation to Princess Beatrix for her steadfast friendship, selfless service, and exemplary leadership as she steps down after 33 years. The Kingdom of the Netherlands is a valued friend of the United States, and we look forward to continuing our close cooperation in the years to come.
