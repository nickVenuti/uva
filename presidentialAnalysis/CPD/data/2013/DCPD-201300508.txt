Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on Senate Confirmation of Regina McCarthy as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency July 18, 2013 I am pleased that today the Senate took bipartisan action to confirm Gina McCarthy as the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. With years of experience at the State and local level, Gina is a proven leader who knows how to build bipartisan support for commonsense environmental solutions that protect the health and safety of our kids while promoting economic growth. Over the past 4 years, I have valued Gina's counsel, and I look forward to having her in my Cabinet as we work to slow the effects of climate change and leave a cleaner environment for future generations.
