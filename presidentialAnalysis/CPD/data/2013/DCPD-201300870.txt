Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on the Death of John S.D. Eisenhower December 22, 2013 Michelle and I send our condolences to the Eisenhower family on the passing of John S.D. Eisenhower. He grew up the son of an American hero, but emerged a great American in his own right: a brave soldier who served in World War II, the Korean war, and ultimately retired with the rank of Brigadier General; an accomplished writer and historian; a talented diplomat. His was a big and quintessentially American life, one of patriotism and character, learning and teaching, and a deep and abiding sense of service to his country. Our thoughts and prayers are with John's wife Joanne, his son David, his daughters Barbara Anne, Susan, and Mary, and his grandchildren, along with our gratitude for his extraordinary life.
