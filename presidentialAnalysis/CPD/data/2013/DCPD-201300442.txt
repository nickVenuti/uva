Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on Senate Confirmation of Michael B. Froman as United States Trade Representative June 19, 2013 I am pleased that the Senate took bipartisan action today to confirm Michael Froman as the United States Trade Representative. Mike has been my closest adviser on a broad range of international economic issues and will continue to play a key role on my economic team. He's trusted and well respected by our partners around the world, and for the last several years, he's been a driving force behind our international economic agenda. In his new position, Mike will stay focused on our primary economic goals: promoting growth, creating jobs, and strengthening the middle class. And he will continue to help open new markets for American businesses, level the playing field for American workers, farmers, and ranchers, and fully enforce our trade rights.
