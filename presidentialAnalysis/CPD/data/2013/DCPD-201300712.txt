Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on the Death of Former Representative C. William Young October 18, 2013 Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Congressman C.W. "Bill" Young. For over 50 years Bill served the people of Florida, both in the State legislature and as the longest serving Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives.
