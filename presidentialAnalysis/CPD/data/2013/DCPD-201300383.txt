Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on the Death of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg June 3, 2013 Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Senator Frank Lautenberg, a proud New Jerseyan who lived America's promise as a citizen and fought to keep that promise alive as a Senator. The son of working class immigrants, Frank joined the Army during World War II, went to college on the GI bill, and cofounded one of America's most successful companies. First elected to the Senate in 1982, he improved the lives of countless Americans with his commitment to our Nation's health and safety, from improving our public transportation to protecting citizens from gun violence, to ensuring that members of our military and their families get the care they deserve. Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to Bonnie, the Lautenberg family, and the people of New Jersey, whom Frank served so well. NOTE: The statement referred to Bonnie Englebardt Lautenberg, wife of Sen. Lautenberg. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Lautenberg, Sen. Frank R.
