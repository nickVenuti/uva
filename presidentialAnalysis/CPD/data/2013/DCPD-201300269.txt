Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on Senator Max S. Baucus's Decision Not To Seek Reelection April 23, 2013 I want to thank Max Baucus for his nearly 35 years of service to the people of Montana. Max has made small businesses a top priority, often taking "Work Days" to visit local businesses across Montana and spend a day working alongside his constituents to gain perspective and help bolster the local economy. As Finance Committee Chairman and a senior member of both the Agriculture and the Environment and Public Works Committees, Max has been a leader on a broad range of issues that touch the lives of Americans across the country. Michelle and I commend Senator Baucus on his career and wish him and his family well in the future. Categories: Statements by the President : Baucus, Sen. Max S., decision not to seek reelection.
