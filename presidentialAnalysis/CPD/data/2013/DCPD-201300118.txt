Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on Senate  Confirmation of Jacob J. "Jack" Lew as Secretary of the Treasury February 27, 2013 I am pleased that the Senate took bipartisan action today to confirm Jack Lew as our Nation's next Treasury Secretary. At this critical time for our economy and our country, there is no one more qualified for this position than Jack. As my Chief of Staff, Jack was by my side as we confronted our Nation's toughest challenges. His reputation as a master of fiscal issues who can work with leaders on both sides of the aisle has already helped him succeed in some of the toughest jobs in Washington. And I will continue to rely on his advice and sound judgment as we work to create good, middle class jobs, provide more people with the skills those jobs require, and ensure every hard-working American can earn a decent living.
