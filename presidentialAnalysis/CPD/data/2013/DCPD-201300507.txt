Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on Senate Confirmation of Thomas E. Perez as Secretary of Labor July 18, 2013 I welcome today's confirmation of Tom Perez to serve as Secretary of Labor. Tom has lived the American dream himself and has dedicated his career to keeping it within reach for hard-working families across the country. At the Department of Labor, Tom will help us continue to grow our economy, help businesses create jobs, make sure workers have the skills those jobs require, and ensure safe workplaces and economic opportunity for all. I want to thank the Senate once again for agreeing to move forward on Tom and the other nominees who have waited far too long for the yes-or-no votes they deserve.
