Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on Senate Confirmation of Charles T. Hagel as Secretary of Defense February 26, 2013 With the bipartisan confirmation of Chuck Hagel as our next Secretary of Defense, we will have the Defense Secretary our Nation needs and the leader our troops deserve. From the moment he volunteered for military service in Vietnam, Chuck has devoted his life to keeping America secure and our Armed Forces strong. An American patriot who fought and bled for our country, he understands our sacred obligations to our servicemembers, military families, and veterans. I will be counting on Chuck's judgment and counsel as we end the war in Afghanistan, bring our troops home, stay ready to meet the threats of our time, and keep our military the finest fighting force in the world. Most of all, I am grateful to Chuck for reminding us that when it comes to our national defense, we are not Democrats or Republicans, we are Americans, and our greatest responsibility is the security of the American people.
