Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on Signing the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act November 21, 2013 Earlier today I signed into law the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that allows scientists to carry out research into organ donations from one person with HIV to another. For decades, these organ transplants have been illegal. It was even illegal to study whether they could be safe and effective. But as our understanding of HIV and effective treatments have grown, that policy has become outdated. The potential for successful organ transplants between people living with HIV has become more of a possibility. The HOPE Act lifts the research ban, and in time, it could lead to livesaving organ donations for people living with HIV while ensuring the safety of the organ transplant process and strengthening the national supply of organs for all who need them. Improving care for people living with HIV is critical to fighting the epidemic, and it's a key goal of my National HIV/AIDS Strategy. The HOPE Act marks an important step in the right direction, and I thank Congress for their action. NOTE: S. 330, approved November 21, was assigned Public Law No. 113â€“51.
