Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on the Resignation of Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality Nancy H. Sutley December 3, 2013 I want to thank Nancy Sutley for her counsel and for her service to the American people over the past 5 years. As one of my top advisers, Nancy has played a central role in overseeing many of our biggest environmental accomplishments, including establishing historic new fuel economy standards that will save consumers money, new national monuments that permanently protect sites unique to our country's rich history and natural heritage, our first comprehensive national ocean policy, and our climate action plan that will help leave our children a safer, healthier planet. Under her leadership, Federal agencies are meeting the goals I set for them at the beginning of the administration by using less energy, reducing pollution, and saving taxpayer dollars. Her efforts have made it clear that a healthy environment and a strong economy aren't mutually exclusive; they can go hand in hand. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.
