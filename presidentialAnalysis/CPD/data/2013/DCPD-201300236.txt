Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on Senate Confirmation of Sarah M.R. "Sally" Jewell as Secretary of the Interior April 10, 2013 I am pleased that today the Senate took bipartisan action to confirm Sally Jewell as our next Secretary of the Interior. With her extensive business experience, including her background in the energy sector, along with her lifelong commitment to conservation, Sally is the right person for this important job. She brings an important mix of strong management skills, appreciation for our Nation's tradition of protecting our public lands and heritage, and a keen understanding of what it means to be good stewards of our natural resources. Sally's commitment to energy and climate issues, her belief in our strong government-to-government relationship with Indian Country, and her understanding of the inherent link between conservation and good jobs ensure that she will be an exceptional Secretary of the Interior. I am very glad she is joining my team, and I look forward to her counsel on these important issues as we continue to leverage our natural resources responsibly while protecting our Nation's treasures for generations to come.
