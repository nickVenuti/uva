Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on the Observance of the Hajj and Eid al-Adha October 15, 2013 Michelle and I extend our best wishes for a joyous Eid al-Adha to Muslims around the world and congratulate those performing the Hajj this year. As our Muslim neighbors and friends gather for Eid celebrations, Muslim Americans are among the more than 3 million pilgrims joining one of the world's largest and most diverse gatherings, which serves as a reminder of the shared roots of the world's Abrahamic faiths. To commemorate Eid al-Adha, Muslims around the world are joining other faith communities in offering their assistance to those suffering from hunger, disease, and conflict. Their service is a powerful example of the positive role that faith can play in motivating communities to work together to address shared challenges. On behalf of the American people, we extend our warmest greetings during this Hajj season. Eid Mubarak and Hajj Mabrour. Categories: Statements by the President : Hajj and Eid al-Adha.
