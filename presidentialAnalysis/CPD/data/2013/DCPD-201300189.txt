Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on Senator Timothy P. Johnson's Decision Not To Seek Reelection March 26, 2013 For more than three decades, Tim Johnson has dedicated himself to improving the lives of South Dakota's working families. From his early days in the State legislature to his distinguished career in the Senate, Tim has worked tirelessly to protect our environment, empower rural and Native American communities, and build a financial system that is better able to serve the American people. Always a fighter, Tim's return to the Senate floor after a life-threatening brain injury was a powerful moment, and his recovery continues to inspire us all. I look forward to working with Senator Johnson as he finishes his third term, and Michelle and I join the people of South Dakota in wishing Tim, Barbara, and their entire family all the best.
