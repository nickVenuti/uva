Administration of Barack Obama, 2013 Statement on the Resignation of Acting Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Commerce Rebecca M. Blank March 18, 2013 I want to thank Dr. Blank for her hard work and exceptional service on behalf of the American people. Over the past 4 years, I have asked Becky to take on several roles at the Department of Commerce, and in each one, she has distinguished herself as a steady leader and a vital member of my economic team. A tireless advocate for American businesses, Becky has helped to increase our competitiveness, support our innovators and entrepreneurs, and bring good-paying jobs back to our shores. While I will be sad to see her go this summer, I want to wish her the best of luck in her exciting new role. I know the University of Wisconsin Badgers will have an outstanding chancellor for years to come.
