Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Deployment of United States Armed Forces Personnel to Iraq June 16, 2014 Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) Starting on June 15, 2014, up to approximately 275 U.S. Armed Forces personnel are deploying to Iraq to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. This force is deploying for the purpose of protecting U.S. citizens and property, if necessary, and is equipped for combat. This force will remain in Iraq until the security situation becomes such that it is no longer needed. This action has been directed consistent with my responsibility to protect U.S. citizens both at home and abroad, and in furtherance of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93â€“148). I appreciate the support of the Congress in these actions. Sincerely, BARACK OBAMA NOTE: Identical letters were sent to John A. Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Patrick J.
