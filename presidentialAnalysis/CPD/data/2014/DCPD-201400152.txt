Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on the 49th Anniversary of the 1965 Voting Rights March  March 7, 2014 Forty-nine years ago, a determined group of Americans marched into history, facing down grave danger in the name of justice and equality, walking to protest the continued discrimination and violence against African Americans. On a day that became known as Bloody Sunday, these brave men and women met billy clubs and tear gas with courage and resolution. Their actions helped set an example for a generation to stand up for the fundamental freedoms due to all people. We recognize those who marched that day and the millions more who have done their part throughout our Nation's history to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice.
