Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on the Death of Benjamin C. Bradlee October 21, 2014 For Benjamin Bradlee, journalism was more than a profession. It was a public good vital to our democracy. A true newspaperman, he transformed the Washington Post into one of the country's finest newspapers, and with him at the helm, a growing army of reporters published the Pentagon Papers, exposed Watergate, and told stories that needed to be told, stories that helped us understand our world and one another a little bit better. The standard he set—a standard for honest, objective, meticulous reporting—encouraged so many others to enter the profession. And that standard is why, last year, I was proud to honor Ben with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Today we offer our thoughts and prayers to Ben's family and all who were fortunate to share in what truly was a good life. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Bradlee, Benjamin C.
