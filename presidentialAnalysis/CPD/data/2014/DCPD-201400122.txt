Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on Representative Edward L. Pastor's Decision Not To Seek Reelection February 27, 2014 The first in his family to graduate from college and the first Hispanic Congressman ever elected from Arizona, Ed Pastor has spent his life fighting to give every American the same chance to work hard and get ahead that this country gave him. Ed has devoted his 23 years in Congress to helping hard-working families, fighting to fix our broken immigration system, and guaranteeing access to quality, affordable health care for all. As one of the most senior members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Ed also has served as a mentor and role model to young Latinos and Latinas throughout Arizona and our country, and his leadership will be missed. Michelle and I thank Congressman Pastor for his service, and we wish him, his wife Verma, and their children and grandchildren the very best in the future.
