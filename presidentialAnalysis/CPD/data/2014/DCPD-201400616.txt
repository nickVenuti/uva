Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on the Death of Former Senator James M. Jeffords August 18, 2014 Michelle and I send our deepest sympathies to the family of Senator James M. Jeffords on his passing. Jim devoted his life to service, as a naval officer, a local leader in his hometown of Shrewsbury, and eventually as a U.S. Senator representing his beloved Vermont. During his more than 30 years in Washington, Jim never lost the fiercely independent spirit that made Vermonters—and people across America—trust and respect him. Whatever the issue—whether it was protecting the environment, supporting Americans with disabilities, or whether to authorize the war in Iraq—Jim voted his principles, even if it sometimes meant taking a lonely or unpopular stance. Vermonters sent him to Washington to follow his conscience, and he did them proud. Our prayers are with the Jeffords family, including his son Leonard and daughter Laura. And we're grateful to Jim for his legacy of service to Vermont and the United States of America. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Jeffords, James M.
