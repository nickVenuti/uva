Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on the First Anniversary of the Shootings at the Washington Navy Yard September 16, 2014 One year ago, our dedicated military and civilian personnel at the Washington Navy Yard were targeted in an unspeakable act of violence that took the lives of 12 American patriots. As we remember men and women taken from us so senselessly, we keep close their family and friends, stand with the survivors who continue to heal, and pay tribute to the first responders who acted with skill and bravery. At the same time, we continue to improve security at our country's bases and installations to protect our military and civilian personnel who help keep us safe. One year ago, 12 Americans went to work to protect and strengthen the country they loved. Today, we must do the same, rejecting atrocities like these as the new normal and renewing our call for commonsense reforms that respect our traditions while reducing the gun violence that shatters too many American families every day.
