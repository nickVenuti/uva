Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Jerusalem, Israel November 18, 2014 I strongly condemn today's terrorist attack on worshipers at a synagogue in Jerusalem, which killed four innocent people, including U.S. citizens Aryeh Kupinsky, Cary William Levine, and Mosheh Twersky, and injured several more. There is and can be no justification for such attacks against innocent civilians. The thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the victims and families of all those who were killed and injured in this horrific attack and in other recent violence. At this sensitive moment in Jerusalem, it is all the more important for Israeli and Palestinian leaders and ordinary citizens to work cooperatively together to lower tensions, reject violence, and seek a path forward towards peace. NOTE: The statement referred to Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, who was killed in the attack at the Kehilat Bnei Torah synagogue.
