Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on the Death of Alan Henning October 3, 2014 The United States strongly condemns the brutal murder of United Kingdom citizen Alan Henning by the terrorist group ISIL. Mr. Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family, and the people of the United Kingdom. Standing together with our U.K. friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder—as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff, and David Haines—to justice.
