These measures could include: o Robust physical protection access controls preferably with multifactor authentication to restrict access to radiological sources; o Monitoring systems designed with defense in depth; for example, redundant and timely alarms and video assessment from multiple sites sent to  a centralized monitoring facility staffed by  trustworthy  personnel; o Enhanced delay measures to allow response forces to arrive in time to address the security threat; o The active involvement of off-site response forces in both maintaining awareness of radiological sources and threats within the city/state/country, as well as engaging sites with radiological sources in planning and training activities (e.g., facility walk-downs, target folder development, tabletop and other exercises); and o A robust and holistic regulatory framework that governs secure source transportation, possession, and disposition.
