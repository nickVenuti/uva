Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on Senate Confirmation of Sarah Saldaña as Director of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement December 16, 2014 I applaud the Senate for confirming Sarah Saldaña as Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. With her years of experience enforcing the law, most recently as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, Sarah is the right person to lead the dedicated men and women at ICE in securing our borders, keeping American communities safe, and upholding our values. Since I took office, illegal border crossings are down, and removal of dangerous criminals is up. I'm confident Sarah will help us build on this progress while protecting our country in a smart, effective, and humane way.
