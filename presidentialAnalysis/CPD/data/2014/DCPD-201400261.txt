Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on the Retirement of Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns  April 11, 2014 Since I met Bill in Moscow in 2005, I have admired his skill and precision. Since I took office, I have relied on him for candid advice and sensitive diplomatic missions. He has been a skilled adviser, consummate diplomat, and inspiration to generations of public servants. Given his vital role on our leading priorities, earlier this year, I asked him to delay his retirement, and I'm grateful to him and Lisa for doing so. The country is stronger for Bill's service. NOTE: The statement referred to Lisa Carty, wife of Deputy Secretary Burns. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a photograph of the President meeting with Deputy Secretary Burns for lunch in the Private Dining Room at the White House on February 18.
