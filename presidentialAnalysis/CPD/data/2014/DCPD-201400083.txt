Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on the Retirement of Abraham H. Foxman as National Director of the Anti-Defamation League February 11, 2014 For decades, Abe Foxman has been a tireless voice against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all of its forms, always calling us to reject hatred and embrace our common humanity. Michelle and I wish him well as he prepares to leave the leadership of the Anti-Defamation League, an organization that he built and led with such passion and persistence. Abe is irreplaceable, but the causes that he has dedicated his life to will continue to inspire people in the United States, Israel, and around the world.
