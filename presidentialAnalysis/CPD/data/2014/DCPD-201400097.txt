Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on Representative Rush D. Holt, Jr.'s Decision Not To Seek Reelection February 18, 2014 Over his 15 years in Congress, Rush Holt combined a relentless focus on building a brighter future with an unwavering commitment to improving the everyday lives of the New Jerseyans he represents, especially the veterans he works tirelessly to support. Just the second research physicist elected to Congress, no one has worked harder to keep America on the cutting edge of innovation than Rush. Time and time again, he has led efforts to fund science education and basic research. His legacy will live on in our labs, our universities, and our classrooms, where countless math and science teachers have been able to afford college thanks in part to the TEACH grants he helped create. Michelle and I thank Congressman Holt for his leadership and service, and we wish him, his wife Margaret, and their children and grandchildren the very best in the future.
