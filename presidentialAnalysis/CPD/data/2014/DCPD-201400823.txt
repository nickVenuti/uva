Administration of Barack Obama, 2014 Statement on the Anniversary of the Birth of the Founder of Sikhism November 6, 2014 I want to congratulate our Sikh friends in the United States and around the world on the anniversary of the birth of the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev Ji. During his lifetime in the 15th and 16th centuries, Guru Nanak traveled throughout the region and world promoting equality, diversity, compassion, and tolerance, which became the core principles of Sikhism. The Sikh American community enriches the United States every day with its embodiment of these values, which are shared not just by Sikhs, but by all Americans.
