Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Normal Trade 
Relations Status for Vietnam

June 2, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''), with respect to a 
further 12-month extension of the authority to waive subsections (a) and 
(b) of section 402 of the Act. This document constitutes my 
recommendation to continue in effect this waiver authority for a further 
12-month period, and includes my reasons for determining that 
continuation of the waiver authority and the waiver currently in effect 
for Vietnam will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of 
the Act.
     Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

 Note:  Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
