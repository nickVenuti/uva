Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Addition of Nigeria Under the 
Generalized System of Preferences

August 24, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)

    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Nigeria to the list 
of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP). The GSP program, which offers duty-free access to the 
U.S. market, was originally authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
    I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 
and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, I have 
determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Nigeria.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f)(1) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
     Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

 Note:  Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on August 
27.
