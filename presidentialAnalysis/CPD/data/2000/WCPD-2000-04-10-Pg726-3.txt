Statement on Senate Inaction on the Supplemental Budget Request

April 4, 2000

    I am very disappointed that Senator Lott plans to deny prompt 
consideration of the urgent and essential needs in my 2000 supplemental 
request, including helping victims of Hurricane Floyd, providing energy 
assistance for families struggling with rising oil prices, helping keep 
illegal drugs out of our country by supporting the Colombian 
Government's fight against drug traffickers, and

building peace and stability in Kosovo to support the efforts of our 
troops there without jeopardizing our current state of military 
readiness worldwide. It is also essential to provide debt relief for the 
world's poorest nations undertaking economic reforms so that they can 
join the global economy.
    I firmly believe that any action to delay consideration of these 
pressing needs would impose unnecessary costs to Americans at home, to 
our interests abroad, and to our military readiness around the world. 
Therefore, I urge the Senate to consider the interests of the Nation and 
to move ahead quickly with work on these urgent and essential needs.
