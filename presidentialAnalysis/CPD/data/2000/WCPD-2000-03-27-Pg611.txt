Exchange With Reporters at the Taj Mahal in Agra, India

March 22, 2000

Visit to the Gandhi Memorial

    Q. Mr. President, what were your thoughts when you were at the 
Gandhi Memorial?
    The President. I was thinking about Gandhi's life. I was thinking 
about his going to South Africa, how he decided to come back here, how 
he completely gave his life over to what he believed, and how if all of 
us just had one fraction of that commitment, we could make peace in the 
world. That's what I was thinking.

Visit to Agra

    Q. Mr. President, are you sort of sad that Agra is sort of a ghost 
town? Would you have liked to pump hands?
    The President. Absolutely. I did see some people----
    Q. Yes, but back there. They were peering----
    The President. I know. I would have liked it if they were up front. 
I'd like that. I wanted to see them.
