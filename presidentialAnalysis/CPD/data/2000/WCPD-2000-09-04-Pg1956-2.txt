Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting an Amendment of the 
Generalized System of Preferences

August 27, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby transmit a Proclamation in which I have determined that it 
is appropriate to grant preferential treatment for Nigeria as a 
beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP). GSP benefits must be granted to Nigeria before that 
nation can receive further trade benefits under the Africa Growth and 
Opportunity Act (Public Law 106-200).
     Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

 Note:  Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
