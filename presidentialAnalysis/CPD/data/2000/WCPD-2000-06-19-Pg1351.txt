Statement on the Death of Frank Patterson

June 12, 2000

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of one of 
Ireland's greatest ambassadors of music, Frank Patterson. A world-class 
tenor, Frank brought the joy of classical and popular music as well as 
Irish culture into the hearts of millions around the world. Hillary and 
I will never forget hearing him perform at the White House. On behalf of 
the American people, we offer our sympathies to his family and friends 
and to the people of Ireland.
