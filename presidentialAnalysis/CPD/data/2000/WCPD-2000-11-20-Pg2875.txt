Statement on Ratification of the Convention To Combat Desertification

November 15, 2000

    On November 13 I signed the instrument of ratification for the 
Convention To Combat Desertification. Degradation of dry lands affects 
hundreds of millions of people around the world, especially in Africa. 
The Convention will help countries marshal the resources needed to 
mitigate the effects of desertification. It will enhance the 
effectiveness of foreign assistance and promote a strong role for 
nongovernmental organizations. Finally, it properly places affected 
local communities at the heart of international efforts to meet this 
critical challenge. I look forward to working with our partners in 
Africa and around the world to implement this innovative international 
agreement. I commend the Senate for its approval of this important 
treaty.
