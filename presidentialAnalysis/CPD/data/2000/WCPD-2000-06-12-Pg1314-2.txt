Statement on the Senate Vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights

June 8, 2000

    I am disappointed that today's vote in the Senate means that the 
American people will continue to wait for the long overdue patient 
protections that they deserve. However, we continue to enjoy 
overwhelming bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and are 
now within a single vote of a bipartisan majority in the Senate. I am 
encouraged by this progress and urge the supporters of a real Patients' 
Bill of Rights to redouble their efforts to pass this critically 
important legislation.
