Subject:  Determination Under Subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 
1974, as Amended: Continuation of Waiver Authority for Belarus

    Pursuant to the authority vested in me under the Trade Act of 1974, 
as amended, Public Law 93-618, 88 Stat. 1978 (the ``Act''), I have 
determined, pursuant to subsection 402 (d)(1) of the Act, 19 U.S.C.

by subsection 402(c) of the Act will substantially promote the
