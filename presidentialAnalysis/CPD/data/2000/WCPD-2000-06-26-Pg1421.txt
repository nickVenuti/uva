Videotape Remarks to Participants of the Scripps Howard National 
Spelling Bee

 June 21, 2000

    I'm glad to have this opportunity to welcome all of you to 
Washington and to the 73d annual National Spelling Bee.
    In 1961, when I was about your age, President Kennedy said we should 
think of education as a private hope and dream, which fulfilled can 
benefit everyone and strengthen our Nation. That's even more true today. 
Your long list of accomplishments, uncommon dedication, and commitment 
to learning will serve as a lifelong asset to you and to your 
communities.
    Regardless of who wins today, you should all be proud of your 
achievements. You've come a long way. So I join your parents and your 
teachers in congratulating you. Your commitment to excellence spells 
success in the years ahead, not just for you but for all America.
    Thank you, and good luck today.

 Note:  The address was videotaped at approximately 5:30 p.m. on May 11 
in the Map Room for later broadcast. A tape was not available for
