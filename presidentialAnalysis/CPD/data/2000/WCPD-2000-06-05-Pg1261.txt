Statement on the Circuit Court of Appeals Decision in the Elian 
Gonzalez Case

June 1, 2000

    I am pleased with the decision today of the Eleventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals. As I have said before, this is a case about the importance 
of family and the bond between a father and son. I have supported the 
Justice Department's conclusion that Elian's father, Juan Miguel 
Gonzalez, is the one best suited to speak for his child, and I am 
pleased that the court has upheld the Justice Department's 
determination.
