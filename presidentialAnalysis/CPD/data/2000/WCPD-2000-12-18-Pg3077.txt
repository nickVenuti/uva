Statement on Guidelines for Environmental Review of Trade Agreements

December 13, 2000

    I am pleased to announce the completion of a strong set of 
guidelines for environmental review of major new trade agreements. These 
detailed guidelines, required by an Executive order I issued last year, 
will ensure that we fully integrate environmental considerations into 
our negotiation of new trade agreements and will provide unparalleled 
opportunities for public involvement in trade policy. America's 
experience has proven that a strong economy and a healthy environment go 
hand in hand, and these new guidelines will help protect the global 
environment as we work with other nations to build prosperity worldwide. 
Bringing environmental issues into the mainstream of our trade policy 
has been a top priority for my administration. The guidelines issued by 
the United States Trade Representative and the Council on Environmental 
Quality are another major milestone in this effort.
