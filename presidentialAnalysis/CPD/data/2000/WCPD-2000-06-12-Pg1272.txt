Subject:  Determination Under Subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 
1974, as Amended: Continuation of Waiver Authority for Vietnam

    Pursuant to subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (the ``Act''), 19 U.S.C. 2432(d)(1), I determine that the 
further extension of the waiver authority granted by subsection 402(c)

the Act. I further determine that the continuation of the waiver 
applicable to Vietnam will substantially promote the objectives of 
section 402 of the Act.
    You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the
