Statement on the Conclusion of the Independent Counsel's Investigation 
of Alexis Herman

April 5, 2000

    I am very pleased to learn that Independent Counsel Ralph Lancaster 
has concluded his investigation. Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman has 
for many years served our Nation with selfless dedication and 
extraordinary talent. She did not deserve what she has had to endure 
over the past many months. As I said at the start of this inquiry, 
nearly 2 years ago, Secretary Herman did nothing wrong. But throughout 
it all, she was never deterred from her mission: making life better for 
America's working families. I am proud to call her my friend, and I am 
honored that she has been willing to work in this administration on 
behalf of working people everywhere.
