Statement on School Overcrowding

August 21, 2000

    This year a record 53 million children will enroll in American 
schools, according to a new report released today by U.S. Secretary of 
Education Richard W. Riley. Over the last 10 years, our public schools 
have grown by 6.6 million students, resulting in overcrowded classrooms 
and strained school facilities. To meet the needs of America's growing 
student population, we need to build new schools and modernize existing 
ones.
    For too long, the Republican leadership in Congress has failed to 
act on tax breaks proposed by my administration to build and modernize 
6,000 schools. They have also failed to pass my proposal to fund urgent 
repairs such as leaky roofs, faulty fire alarms, and inadequate furnaces 
at 25,000 schools across the country. I remain strongly committed to 
working with Members of both parties to help create safe and modern 
places for America's students to learn. Our children deserve no less.
