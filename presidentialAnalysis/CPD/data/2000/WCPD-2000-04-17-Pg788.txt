 Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting on Iraq's Compliance With 
United Nations Security Council Resolutions

 April 10, 2000

 Dear Mr. Speaker:    (Dear Mr. President:)

     Consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1), and as part of my effort to keep the 
Congress fully informed, I am reporting on the status of efforts to 
obtain Iraq's compliance with the resolutions adopted by the United 
Nations Security Council. My last report, consistent with Public Law 
102-1, was dated January 7, 2000. I shall continue to keep the Congress 
informed about this important issue.
     Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

  Note:  Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of 
the House of Representatives, and Strom Thurmond, President pro tempore 
of the Senate.
