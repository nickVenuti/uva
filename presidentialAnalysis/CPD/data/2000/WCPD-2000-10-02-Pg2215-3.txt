Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on the Partnership 
For Peace

September 25, 2000

Dear Mr. Chairman:

    Pursuant to section 514 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law 103-236), and section 205 of the 
NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103-447), I 
hereby transmit to you a report concerning Partnership for Peace (PFP) 
developments through July 15, 2000.
    The PFP has been an unqualified success since its establishment in 
1994. As reviewed in this year's report, through the PFP, Partners have 
built stronger ties with the Alliance and developed closer cooperative 
relationships with their neighbors. The PFP, and its political 
component, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, have also provided a 
means for incorporating Partners into NATO's operations in Bosnia and 
Kosovo, and assisting those countries that want to join NATO to 
implement reforms through the Membership Action Plan process. In 
addition, enhancements to the PFP have provided an improved mechanism 
for Partners to use in developing the interoperability with NATO that 
will be necessary for future NATO-led Allied/Partner missions.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations, and Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman, House 
Committee on International Relations. This letter was released by the 
Office of the Press Secretary on September 26.
