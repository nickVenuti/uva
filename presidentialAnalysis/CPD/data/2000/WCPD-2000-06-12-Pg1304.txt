Statement on Termination of the Ukraine-United States Commercial Space 
Launch Agreement

June 5, 2000

    I am pleased to announce that today the United States has terminated 
the commercial space launch trade agreement with Ukraine. This decision 
eliminates launch quotas and gives U.S. firms greater opportunity to 
enter into commercial space launch joint ventures with Ukrainian 
partners without limit and reflects Ukraine's steadfast commitment to 
international nonproliferation norms.
