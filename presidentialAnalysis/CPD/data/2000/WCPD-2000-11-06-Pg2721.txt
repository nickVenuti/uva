Statement on Signing Legislation on the Appointment of the Inspector 
General of the Tennessee Valley Authority

November 1, 2000

    Today I am pleased to sign into law S. 1707. This bill provides that 
the Inspector General of the Tennessee Valley Authority is to be 
appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the 
Senate. Current law provides for the appointment of the Inspector 
General by the Authority's Board of Directors. Under this legislation, 
the appointment of the Authority's Inspector General would be made 
consistent with the appointment of inspectors general at other large 
agencies. This is an appropriate change.
    This bill also authorizes the establishment within the Department of 
the Treasury of a forensic laboratory to provide services to the Federal 
Government's Offices of Inspectors General. In implementing this 
legislation, my Administration will take care both to avoid duplication 
with other, ongoing forensic activities, and to ensure effective and 
efficient coordination and cooperation with existing Federal forensic 
laboratories, such as those operated by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, the Secret Service, and the Postal Service.
                                            William J. Clinton
 The White House,
 November 1, 2000.

Note: S. 1707, approved November 1, was assigned Public Law No. 106-422.
