working. By making the tough choices necessary to turn record deficits 
into record surpluses, we are now in a position to start paying down the

April to June--the largest debt pay down in our Nation's history. By the 
end of this fiscal year, we will have repaid approximately $300 billion 
in debt. If we continue on this path of fiscal discipline, we can pay

President. This will keep interest rates low and investment high and 
lead to savings on everything from mortgages to student loans for 
working families across America.
