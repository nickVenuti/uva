Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Normal Trade 
Relations Status for Belarus

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

continuation of the waiver currently in effect for the Republic of 
Belarus under subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 
(the ``Act'') will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 
of the Act.
     Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton
