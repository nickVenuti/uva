Statement on the Bombing of a School in Sudan

February 14, 2000

    I am deeply concerned by reports that the Government of Sudan bombed 
a school in the Nuba Mountain region on February 8, killing and wounding 
many young children. It is an outrage that such egregious abuses against 
innocent Sudanese citizens have become commonplace in the ongoing civil 
war in Sudan, which has claimed over 2 million lives.
    The United States calls on the Government of Sudan to cease all 
aerial bombardment and to refrain from any attacks on
civilian targets. We also call for full and immediate access for 
humanitarian organizations seeking to provide relief to war-ravaged 
civilians in Sudan.
