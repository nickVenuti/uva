    Q.  Mr. President, how is it going, Mr. President?
    Q.  How long is it going to take, Mr. President?
    The President.  We pledged to each other we would answer no 
questions and offer no comment, and I'd like to set a good example. 
[Laughter]
    Q.  Can you resist us, sir?
    The President.  It's difficult to resist, but I will make it--today, 
at least.
    Q.  Is that the only agreement you have reached so far? [Laughter]
    The President.  That would be answering a question. [Laughter]
    Thank you.
