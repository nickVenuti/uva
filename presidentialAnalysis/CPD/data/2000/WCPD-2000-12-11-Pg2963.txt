Letter to Congressional Leaders on Modifications to the List of 
Beneficiary Developing Countries Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences

December 1, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    I hereby notify you of my intent to modify the list of beneficiary 
developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), 
which offers duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible products 
imported from designated beneficiary developing countries. Specifically, 
I intend to change the designation of ``Western Samoa'' to ``Samoa,'' to 
reflect this nation's current name, in the list of beneficiary 
developing countries and to designate Samoa as a least-developed 
beneficiary developing country under the GSP. I have carefully 
considered the criteria in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974 
and have determined that it is appropriate to designate Samoa as such.

    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
     Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
