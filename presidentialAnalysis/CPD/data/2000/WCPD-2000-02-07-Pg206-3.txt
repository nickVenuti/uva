celebrates the miracle of life, the promise of a new year, and the 
blessings of family, friends, and community. It also reminds us of the 
many contributions that Asian Americans bring to our national life and 
of the many ways in which their customs, history, and traditions have 
enriched our country's cultural heritage.
    Asian Americans play a key role in all segments of our society, from 
the scientists who have helped to build our national defense and to 
power our unmatched technological progress to the artists whose talents 
grace our literature, stage, and screen. America is strengthened by 
these contributions, and we must work to ensure that Asian Americans are 
afforded every opportunity to be active and equal participants in our 
national life.
    As people across America and around the world mark the beginning of 
a new lunar cycle, Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for 
health, happiness, prosperity, and peace in the new year.
                                                  Bill Clinton
