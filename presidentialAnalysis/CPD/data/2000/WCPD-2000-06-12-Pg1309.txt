Statement on the Earthquake in Indonesia

June 6, 2000

    I was saddened to learn of the earthquakes that shook the island of 
Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia. On behalf of the American people, 
I extend my deepest sympathies to all those who have suffered losses and 
injuries.
    The United States is providing emergency assistance to support 
relief efforts and stands ready to provide further help to meet the 
needs of those affected by the earthquake.
