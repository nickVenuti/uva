Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process

May 5, 2000

    I am greatly encouraged that Prime Ministers Blair and Ahern have 
announced that their intensive talks in Belfast over the past 2 days 
have made progress, providing a sound basis for restoring the political 
institutions and achieving full implementation of the Good Friday 
accord. I urge the parties and paramilitary organizations to seize this 
opportunity to realize these goals in order to secure lasting peace for 
the people of Northern Ireland. The United States remains prepared to 
assist in any way we can.

Note: In his statement, the President referred to Prime Minister Tony 
Blair of the United Kingdom; and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland.
