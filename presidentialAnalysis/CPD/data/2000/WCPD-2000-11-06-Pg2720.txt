 Statement on Signing an Extension of the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization 
Act of 2000

 November 1, 2000

     Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 5234, which extends the 
applicability of the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000 to 
certain former spouses of deceased Hmong veterans. This bill will make 
these widows eligible for the eased naturalization requirements provided 
by the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000, which I signed into 
law in May of this year. Many of these widows and their families 
sacrificed a great deal as their spouses fought in support of the U.S. 
military during the conflict in Southeast Asia. Many have had to 
struggle to make a new life in this country, and to raise their 
families, and despite language and cultural barriers, they have made 
significant contributions to our Nation. This legislation will help 
ensure that they become full-fledged citizens in our society.
                                            William J. Clinton
 The White House,
 November 1, 2000.

  Note:  H.R. 5234, approved November 1, was assigned Public Law No. 
106-415.
