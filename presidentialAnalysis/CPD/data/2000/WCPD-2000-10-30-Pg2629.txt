Message on the Observance of Diwali, 2000

October 25, 2000

    Warm greetings to Indian Americans across our country as you observe 
the festival of Diwali.
    This ancient and joyous holiday, with origins in the Hindu faith, 
reflects both the unity and the rich diversity of the people and culture 
of India. It is truly a ``festival of lights,'' marked by lighting 
candles and lamps, setting off firecrackers, and dressing in vibrant 
colors. During Diwali, Indians of all ages and backgrounds come together 
to celebrate life, the triumph of good over evil, and the hope for 
happiness and prosperity that we all share.
    America has become home to men and women from countries across the 
globe, whose skills and perspective have enriched our culture, enhanced 
our economy, and broadened our vision of the world. Diwali presents all 
of us with an opportunity to reflect on the many ways the talents, 
history, and traditions of the Indian people have contributed to our 
national life and cultural heritage and to give thanks for the 
extraordinary diversity that is one of our nation's greatest strengths.
    Hillary and I extend best wishes to all for a wonderful celebration.
                                            William J. Clinton
