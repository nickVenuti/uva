Bourguiba. On behalf of the American people, I want to extend our 
heartfelt condolences to President Bourguiba's family and to the 
Tunisian people.
    President Bourguiba was a historic leader, a pioneer in Tunisia's 
struggle for independence and for social and economic progress. He also 
played a courageous role in efforts to advance peace in the Middle East. 
He leaves behind a nation that can be proud of its social achievements, 
particularly the steps it has taken to advance the status of women, and 
a nation poised to take on the critical challenges of deepening 
democracy and respect for human rights--and building a better future for 
all Tunisians.
