Statement on Congressional Action on Africa and Caribbean Basin Trade 
Legislation

May 11, 2000

    I am pleased that Congress has completed action on historic 
legislation that will boost investment, growth, and opportunity in 
Africa and the Caribbean Basin, while improving the global competitive 
position of our own industries. This step reaffirms America's commitment 
to open trade and strengthens the partnership between the United States 
and our friends in Africa and the Caribbean Basin. It will encourage 
these nations to continue building open economies, bolster their efforts 
to alleviate poverty, and improve long-term prospects for democracy and 
stability around the world. I look forward to signing this measure into 
law and congratulate Members of Congress from both parties who have 
worked so hard to enact the ``African Growth and Opportunity Act'' and 
the Caribbean Basin trade enhancement legislation.
