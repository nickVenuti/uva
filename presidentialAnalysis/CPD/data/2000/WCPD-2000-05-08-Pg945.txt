Letter to Congressional Leaders on Imports of Crude Oil

April 28, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Pursuant to section 232(c) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1862(c)), I am notifying you that I concur with the 
findings of the Secretary of Commerce in his report, ``The Effect on the 
National Security of Imports of Crude Oil and Refined Petroleum 
Products,'' which determined that imports of crude oil threaten to 
impair the national security.
    Further, I have accepted his recommendation that trade remedies not 
be imposed but that existing policies to enhance conservation and limit 
the dependence on foreign oil be continued. I am taking this action 
because we have already proposed additional tax credits to promote 
renewable and efficient sources of energy, new tax incentives to support 
the domestic petroleum industry, and further investments in energy-
saving technologies and alternative energy sources, as the report 
suggested.
     Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
