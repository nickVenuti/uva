Statement on the Election of Ricardo Lagos as President of Chile

January 17, 2000

    I congratulate Ricardo Lagos on his victory in Chile's Presidential 
election on Sunday, January 16. I also congratulate the Chilean people 
for an election that was a model of civic participation and evidence of 
their strong commitment to democratic government.
    I look forward to working with President-elect Lagos and to 
deepening the friendship and cooperation that have characterized the 
excellent relations between our two nations.
