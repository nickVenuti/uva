Radio Remarks on Funding To Make Communities More Livable

February 14, 2000

    Across America, communities are struggling to protect precious lands 
so their children will have places to play, hike, and enjoy the great 
outdoors. Today I'm announcing nearly $60 million in new grants to help 
communities in all 50 States create parks, preserve forests, and save 
open space.
    And the lands legacy initiative in my new budget will provide 
permanent funding so that communities can conserve additional lands year 
after year.
