Statement on Census 2000

December 28, 2000

    Today I am pleased to receive from the Department of Commerce the 
first data released from Census 2000, our country's 22d decennial 
census. I congratulate Secretary Norman Mineta, Secretary William Daley, 
and Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt for their leadership in 
Census 2000, the longest continuous scientific effort in American 
democracy. Since 1790, these data collected during each decennial census 
help to tell the ongoing story of America, its rich heritage and broad 
diversity. Most importantly, I want to thank the American people for 
their participation in Census 2000. With their help, the country is 
better equipped to meet the needs of every American and the challenges 
in the 21st century.
