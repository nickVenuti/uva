2000 Presidential Election

    The President. Good afternoon. Well, if ever there was a doubt about 
the importance of exercising democracy's most fundamental right, the 
right to vote, yesterday put it to rest. No American will ever be able 
to seriously say again, ``My vote doesn't count.''
    The American people have now spoken, but it's going to take a little 
while to determine exactly what they said. The process for that is in 
motion, and the rest of us will have to let it play out.
    I want to congratulate Vice President Gore and Governor Bush on a 
vigorous, hard-fought, truly remarkable campaign.
    Thank you very much.

Conversation With Vice President Gore

    Q. Mr. President, did you advise the Vice President to rescind his 
concession last night?
    The President. No, sir. I didn't talk to him about it at all, one 
way or the other. I talked to him afterward.
    We had a great talk later, when the situation was as it is now, and 
we were laughing. We had a--he was in a good humor. He talked--we talked 
about the unpredictability of life and how he'd done all he could, and 
he was pleased that he was ahead in the popular vote at the time. I 
don't know what the latest totals are. And we had a very good talk. And 
he congratulated Hillary, and they had a nice little visit.

    But I was just like you last night--I was a fascinated observer. 
Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 3:26 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Republican Presidential candidate 
Gov. George W. Bush.
