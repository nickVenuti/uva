Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to the Lapse of the Export Administration Act of 
1979

August 3, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    On August 19, 1994, in light of the expiration of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.), I 
issued Executive Order 12924, declaring a national emergency and 
continuing the system of export regulation under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). Under section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), the national 
emergency terminates on the anniversary date of its declaration unless 
the President publishes in the  Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice of its continuation.
    I am hereby advising the Congress that I have extended the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 12924. Enclosed is a copy of the 
notice of extension.
     Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

 Note:  Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
