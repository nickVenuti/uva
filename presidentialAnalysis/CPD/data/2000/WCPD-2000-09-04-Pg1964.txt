Statement on the United Airlines Labor Agreement

August 27, 2000

    I am pleased that United Airlines and its pilots have reached an 
agreement at the bargaining table. I commend union and management for 
working together to resolve their differences in a way that will benefit 
the traveling public. I am also encouraged that over the last week the 
aviation industry met with Secretary Slater and pledged to work with my 
administration to address the service related issues and the long-term 
outlook for quality customer service.
