Message to the Senate Transmitting the Protocol Amending the 1950 
Ireland-United States Consular Convention With Documentation

September 5, 2000

To the Senate of the United States:

    I transmit herewith, for the Senate's advice and consent to 
ratification, the Protocol Amending the 1950 Consular Convention Between 
the United States of America and Ireland, signed at Washington on June 
16, 1998. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
    The Protocol expands the scope of tax exemption under the 1950 
Consular Convention Between the United States of America and Ireland to 
provide for reciprocal exemption from all taxes, including Value Added 
Taxes (VAT) on goods and services for the official use of the mission or 
for the personal use of mission members and families. The amendment will 
provide financial benefit to the United States, both through direct 
savings on embassy purchases of goods and services as well as through 
lowering the cost of living for United States Government employees 
assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Dublin.
    Because the Protocol will achieve long-term tax exemption on the 
purchase of goods and services for our embassy and personnel in Ireland, 
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to 
the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.
                                            William J. Clinton
 The White House,
 September 5, 2000.
