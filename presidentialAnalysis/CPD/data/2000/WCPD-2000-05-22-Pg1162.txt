Statement on China-European Union Negotiations on China's Accession to 
the World Trade Organization

May 19, 2000

    I welcome the conclusion of the bilateral negotiations between China 
and the European Union on China's accession to the WTO. This agreement 
highlights the importance of congressional passage of permanent normal 
trade relations with China.
    It is now clearer than ever that China will join the World Trade 
Organization. For America to reap the broad benefits of China's historic 
decision to open its markets and to strengthen the forces of positive 
change in China, Congress must enact PNTR. A vote against PNTR will cost 
America exports and jobs, cede this massive new market to our 
competitors in Europe and Japan, and embolden those resisting reform in 
China.
