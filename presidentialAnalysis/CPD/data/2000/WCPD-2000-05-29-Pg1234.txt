Statement on the Upcoming Elections in Peru

May 26, 2000

    I deeply regret the decision by the
Peruvian electoral authorities to proceed with the elections this coming 
Sunday in spite of the well-documented concerns of the OAS observer 
mission. Even a relatively brief delay would give the OAS mission an 
opportunity to monitor the electoral process with greater confidence.
    As things stand, the OAS mission will not monitor Sunday's vote. I 
believe that is the correct decision under the circumstances.
    Free, fair, and open elections are the foundation of a democratic 
society. Without them, our relationship with Peru inevitably will be 
affected.
