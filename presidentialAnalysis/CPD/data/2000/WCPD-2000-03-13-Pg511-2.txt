Statement on Minimum Wage Legislation

March 9, 2000

    The minimum wage must be raised but not with a bill that stacks the 
deck against America's working families. This bill repeals key overtime 
protections, could reduce pension coverage for many families, and 
includes risky tax giveaways that threaten our prosperity and the future 
of Social Security and Medicare. Once again, Republicans in the House of 
Representatives have demonstrated that they would rather fight for 
special interests than give working families the raise they deserve.
    I will veto the bill Republicans in the House passed tonight if it 
comes to my desk. Congress should send me a bill I can sign: a clean 
straightforward bill that raises the minimum wage by a dollar over 2 
years.
