Statement on Legislation on Trade With the Caribbean Basin and Africa

May 4, 2000

    Today's vote is a key milestone toward enactment of legislation that 
will launch a new era of cooperation between the United States and our 
partners in Africa and the Caribbean Basin. This important measure will 
strengthen our economic partnership with these nations, lower trade 
barriers, help developing nations to lift their people out of poverty, 
and create a more secure world. I congratulate those Members of Congress 
who have worked hard to reach agreement on this bill. I look forward to 
signing this historic legislation into law upon final passage.
