Statement on the Death of Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.

January 2, 2000

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Admiral 
Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., today.
    In both wartime and peacetime, Admiral Zumwalt exemplified the ideal 
of service to our Nation. He was a genuine patriot with an astonishing 
life story. A distinguished veteran of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, 
he rose to become the Chief of Naval Operations, the Navy's top post. As 
CNO, he worked vigorously to improve our sailor's quality of life and 
devoted himself to eliminating discrimination in the Navy.
    But more than most Americans who have served our country with 
distinction, Admiral Zumwalt paid a deeply personal price for his 
dedication when his son died of an ailment related to service in 
Vietnam. Admiral Zumwalt became a great champion of veterans with war-
related health problems. He established the first national bone marrow 
donor program to help cancer patients in need. He never stopped fighting 
for the interests, the rights, and the dignity of soldiers, sailors, 
airmen, and marines and their families.
    Admiral Zumwalt was one of the greatest models of integrity, 
leadership, and genuine humanity our Nation has ever produced. I was 
proud to award him the Medal of Freedom in 1998 for his lifetime of 
dedicated public service.
    At this time of sorrow, our prayers and sympathies go out to his 
family and friends.
