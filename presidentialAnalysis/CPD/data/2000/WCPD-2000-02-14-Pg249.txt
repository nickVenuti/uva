Statement on the Election of Stipe Mesic as President of Croatia

February 8, 2000

    I congratulate President-elect Stipe Mesic on his victory in 
Monday's elections in Croatia. Mr. Mesic's victory is a turning point 
for Croatia. It brings with it the promise of genuine democracy and a 
normal life for Croatia's people, stronger ties between our two nations, 
and greater stability throughout southeast Europe. The people of Croatia 
have clearly demonstrated their desire to see their country take its 
rightful place in Europe. The United States will do everything it can to 
help them reach their destination. And together we will send a clear 
message to all the people of the Balkans that a brighter future is 
within their grasp.
    I look forward to working closely with President-elect Mesic, Prime 
Minister Racan, and the new government in Zagreb.

Note: In the statement, the President referred to Prime Minister Ivica 
Racan of Croatia.
