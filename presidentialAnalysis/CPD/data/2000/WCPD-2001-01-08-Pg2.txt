Memorandum on Potential Electricity Shortages in Western States 

December 30, 2000

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Potential Electricity Shortages in Western States

    Increased demand for electricity during cold winter weather can make 
it a challenge for electric utilities to meet the demand of their 
customers and keep lights on and their homes and businesses warm. 
Currently, the supply of electric power is tight on the West Coast due 
to record demand for electricity. The region faces the possibility of

shortages in some areas, which would put both consumers and businesses 
at risk.
    The Federal Government is among the largest consumers of electricity 
in Western States. It is important that the Federal Government lead by 
example in taking energy conserving steps to reduce the risk and 
severity of power outages. Therefore, I direct that:
 <bullet>    All managers of all Federal buildings in Washington and 
            Oregon join those in California and take steps to reduce 
            consumption of power to the maximum extent practicable 
            consistent with public health and welfare, and that of 
            employees; and
 <bullet>    Federal agencies coordinate with other State and local 
            government agencies to minimize the use of electricity in 
            all government buildings in Washington, Oregon, and 
            California.
    When the Federal Government, State governments, businesses, and 
consumers work together to use electricity wisely, we can reduce the 
risk of power shortages in the short term and keep the power on.
                                            William J. Clinton
