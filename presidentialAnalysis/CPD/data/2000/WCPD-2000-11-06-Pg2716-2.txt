Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Sudan

October 31, 2000

To the Congress of the United States:

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the Sudan emergency is to continue in 
effect beyond November 3, 2000, to the Federal Register for publication.
    The crisis between the United States and Sudan that led to the 
declaration on November 3, 1997, of a national emergency has not been 
resolved. The Government of Sudan has continued its activities hostile 
to United States interests. Such Sudanese actions and policies pose a 
continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States. For these reasons, I have 
determined that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad 
authorities necessary to apply economic pressure on the Government of 
Sudan.
                                            William J. Clinton
 The White House,
 October 31, 2000.

 Note:  This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on November 1.
