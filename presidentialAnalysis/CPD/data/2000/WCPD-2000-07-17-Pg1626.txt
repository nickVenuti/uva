Statement on the Accident
in the Philippines

July 12, 2000

    I was deeply saddened to learn of the lives lost and families 
devastated by the terrible incident that took place on the outskirts of 
Manila. On behalf of the American people, I extend my deepest sympathies 
to all those who have suffered losses and injuries. Our thoughts and 
prayers also go out to those who are still waiting to hear word about 
friends and family members still missing.

Note: On July 11, debris from the collapse of the Payatas garbage dump 
killed more than 100 area residents.
