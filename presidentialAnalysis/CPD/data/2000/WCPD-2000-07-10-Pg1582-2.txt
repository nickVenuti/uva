Statement on the Election of Vicente Fox as President of Mexico

July 3, 2000

    I called President-elect Vicente Fox today to offer my 
congratulations and those of the American people on his historic victory 
in Mexico's national elections yesterday. I also spoke to President 
Zedillo to express my admiration for his extraordinary contributions to 
Mexico, including his efforts in working with other Mexican leaders to 
strengthen and deepen democracy. Mexicans should be proud of the 
extraordinary steps they have taken during the last 6 years to 
strengthen and consolidate democratic institutions and set Mexico on a 
course of economic growth and prosperity.
    Mexico is our neighbor and friend. Mexico's national elections, the 
freest and fairest in the nation's history, stand as a vivid testimony 
to the depth of the democratic commitment of the Mexican people. I 
reiterated both to President-elect Fox and President Zedillo that the 
United States stands ready to work to enhance the close cooperation that 
characterizes our bilateral relationship.
