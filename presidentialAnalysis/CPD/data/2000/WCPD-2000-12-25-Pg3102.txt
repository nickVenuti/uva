Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process

December 15, 2000

    I am delighted that loyalist paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland 
have today committed themselves to an open-ended cessation of 
hostilities and developed peaceful mechanisms to address disputes that 
may arise. This action responds to the overwhelming desire of the people 
of Northern Ireland to see their peace flourish and endure, which I 
sensed during my visit this week. I congratulate the loyalist political 
leaders who I know worked so hard to bring this about.
