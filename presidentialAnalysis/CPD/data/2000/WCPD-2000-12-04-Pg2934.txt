Remarks in a Meeting With Metropolitan Law Enforcement Leaders

November 28, 2000

    Well, first of all, you guys look good on the steps here. [Laughter] 
Maybe you should just stay all day. It would be great.
    I want to thank you for all the help you've given us these last 8 
years, in all my many movements and oftentimes in very crowded times of 
the day and difficult circumstances. And I'm very, very grateful to all 
of you, and before I left, I just wanted to have a chance to get 
everybody together and say thank you.
    I've had a wonderful time these last 8 years. And I was able to do 
my job in no small measure because of what you did, and I hope you'll 
always be glad that you did it.
    I thank you very, very much. Merry Christmas.

Note: The President spoke at 10:25 a.m. on the steps of the Dwight D. 
Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
