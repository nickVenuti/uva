Statement on Returning Without Approval to the House of Representatives 
the Legislative Branch and the Treasury and General Appropriations Act, 
2001

October 30, 2000

    I am returning herewith without my approval, H.R. 4516, the 
Legislative Branch and the Treasury and General Appropriations Act, 
2001. This bill provides funds for the legislative branch and the White 
House at a time when the business of the American people remains 
unfinished.
    The Congress' continued refusal to focus on the priorities of the 
American people leaves me no alternative but to veto this bill. I cannot 
in good conscience sign a bill that funds the operations of the Congress 
and the White House before funding our classrooms,

fixing our schools, and protecting our workers.
    With the largest student enrollment in history, we need ad budget 
that will allow us to repair and modernize crumbling schools, reduce 
class size, hire more and better trained teachers, expand after-school 
programs, and strengthen accountability to turn around failing schools.
    I would sign this legislation in the context of a budget that puts 
the interests of the American people before self-interest or special 
interests. I urge the Congress to get its priorities in order and send 
me, without further delay, balanced legislation I can sign.
                                            William J. Clinton
 The White House,
 October 30, 2000.
