Statement on Action To Prosecute for the Killing of United States 
Department of Agriculture Inspectors

June 23, 2000

    Today the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California 
filed a complaint charging an individual with the intentional killing of 
two U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors in the course of their 
duties. I want to commend Federal and local law enforcement for working 
so quickly to investigate and prosecute this important case. Our 
thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims, their families, and 
the community during this difficult time.
