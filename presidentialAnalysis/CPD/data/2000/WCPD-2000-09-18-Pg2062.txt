Statement on Action on Japanese Whaling Practices

September 13, 2000

    Following Secretary Mineta's certification that Japan is undermining 
international whaling protections with its expanded whaling program, I 
am today directing that Japan be denied future access to fishing rights 
in U.S. waters and directing members of my Cabinet to consider 
additional steps we might take, including possible trade sanctions.
    Strong international cooperation has allowed the recovery of many 
whale species once pushed to the brink of extinction. We must work to 
ensure that these protections are upheld. I hope that the steps we take 
today will encourage Japan to reverse its actions and respect the strong 
international consensus that has helped bring back some of Earth's most 
majestic creatures.
