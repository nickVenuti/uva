Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on Partial Birth Abortion

June 28, 2000

    I am pleased with the Supreme Court's decision today in  Stenberg  
v.  Carhart  striking down a Nebraska statute that banned so-called 
partial birth abortions. The Court's decision is consistent with my past 
vetoes of similar legislation. I will continue to veto any legislation 
restricting late-term abortions that lacks a health exception or 
otherwise unduly burdens a woman's right to choose. A woman's right to 
choose must include the right to choose a medical procedure that will 
not endanger her life or health. Today's decision recognizes this 
principle and marks an important victory for a woman's freedom of 
choice.
