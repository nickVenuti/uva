Statement on Signing the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform 
Act for the 21st Century

April 5, 2000

    Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 1000, the ``Wendell H. Ford 
Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century.'' This 
legislation contains important measures to improve aviation safety, 
increase airline competition, protect air travelers with disabilities, 
and boost assistance for the families of victims of aviation disasters. 
The bill also takes an additional step toward our long-term objectives 
for modernizing and reforming the FAA's provision of critical air 
traffic control services.
    I call on Congress to join me in moving forward to further system-
wide reform of air traffic control. While this legislation seeks to 
provide substantial funding guarantees for airport construction and 
other capital investment, I remain concerned about the possible effect 
of the bill's procedural requirements on future appropriations for air 
traffic control and other crucial safety functions funded by the FAA's 
Operations account. My administration will work with the Congress to 
achieve more balanced funding of aviation programs in fiscal year 2001.

 Note:  H.R. 1000, approved April 5, was assigned Public Law No. 106-
181.
