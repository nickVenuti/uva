Statement on the Death of Henry B. Gonzalez

November 29, 2000

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of 
Congressman Henry Gonzalez.
    Congressman Gonzalez was a trailblazer and a leader for all of 
Texas. From his election to the San Antonio city council and the Texas 
Senate to his successful career in Congress, Henry spent more than 40 
years serving his State and his country. He was the first Hispanic to 
serve in the Texas State Senate in more than 100 years and the first 
Mexican-American elected from Texas to serve in Congress.
    As chairman of the House Banking Committee, Congressman Gonzalez 
championed the issues of America's working families, fighting tirelessly 
for economic justice, civil rights, banking reform, and affordable 
housing. His work over the decades was recognized with countless honors 
and awards, including the 1994 John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage 
award. Henry will forever be remembered as a man of conviction and 
humility who devoted his life to lifting people up and building bridges 
of understanding.
    Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Bertha, his children, 
and his family and friends.
