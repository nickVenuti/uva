Statement on Reaching the Nation's Highest Homeownership Rate

October 26, 2000

    Today I am proud to announce that our Nation has broken a new 
record. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
America has reached its highest homeownership rates ever. This is 
tremendous new evidence that more and more American families are 
realizing the dream of owning their own home. Higher homeownership rates 
help build stronger families, create more stable communities, and raise 
living standards for all Americans.
    Vice President Gore and I came to office committed to a strategy to 
make it easier for American families to buy their own homes. By 
providing record levels of homeownership loan assistance, increasing the 
availability of affordable housing, providing incentives to save for a 
home purchase, and maintaining our commitment to fiscal discipline that 
has kept interest rates low, we have worked to ensure that every family 
has the opportunity to own their own home. I would like to particularly 
thank Vice President Gore and Secretary Cuomo for their excellent 
leadership in working with families, especially in low-income and 
empowerment communities, to help make homeownership a reality.
