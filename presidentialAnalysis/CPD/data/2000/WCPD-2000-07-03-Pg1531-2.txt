Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on Restriction of Protests 
Outside Health Care Facilities

June 28, 2000

    I am pleased that the Supreme Court today, in  Hill  v.  Colorado,  
upheld a Colorado statute balancing a person's right to protest certain 
medical procedures against another person's right to obtain medical 
treatment free from harassment, fear, and intimidation. The Colorado law 
was enacted in response to a real need to ensure safe access to medical 
treatment in light of increasing obstruction, harassment, and violence 
in front of health care facilities. To preserve a woman's right to 
choose, we must protect access to reproductive health services. That is 
why I championed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE), a 
Federal statute that protects women and doctors from violence at 
reproductive health clinics.

Note: The statement referred to Public Law No. 103-259, approved May 26, 
1994.
