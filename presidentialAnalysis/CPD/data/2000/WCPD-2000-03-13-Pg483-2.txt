Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus

March 7, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)

    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you a report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus 
question covering the period December 1, 1999, to January 31, 2000. The 
previous submission covered events during October and November 1999.
    The United Nations convened 12 days of intensive talks to resolve 
the Cyprus dispute in early December. United Nations Secretary General 
Annan reported that both parties engaged seriously on the whole range of 
issues that divide them. My Special Envoy for Cyprus, Alfred H. Moses, 
and his team provided critical diplomatic support for the United Nations 
efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement.
    Talks resumed in Geneva on January 31 where United Nations Special 
Advisor Alvaro de Soto held a series of meetings with both sides. The 
parties will continue discussions on May 23 in New York. We welcome this 
important process, and we will continue to work with the United Nations 
to reach a solution for all Cypriots based on a bizonal, bicommunal 
federation.
    Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
