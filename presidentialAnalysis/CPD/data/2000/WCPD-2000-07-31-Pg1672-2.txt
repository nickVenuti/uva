Trilateral Statement: Middle East Peace Summit

July 25, 2000

    Between July 11 and 24, under the auspices of President Clinton, 
Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat met at Camp David in an effort 
to reach an agreement on permanent status. While they were not able to 
bridge the gaps and reach an agreement, their negotiations were 
unprecedented in both scope and detail. Building on the progress 
achieved at Camp David, the two leaders agreed on the following 
principles to guide their negotiations:
 1)          The two sides agreed that the aim of their negotiations is 
            to put an end to decades of conflict and achieve a just and 
            lasting peace.
 2)          The two sides commit themselves to continue their efforts 
            to conclude an agreement on all permanent status issues as 
            soon as possible.
 3)          Both sides agree that negotiations based on UN Security 
            Council Resolutions 242 and 338 are the only way to achieve 
            such an agreement and they undertake to create an 
            environment for negotiations free from pressure, 
            intimidation and threats of violence.
 4)          The two sides understand the importance of avoiding 
            unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of negotiations 
            and that their differences will be resolved only by good 
            faith negotiations.
 5)          Both sides agree that the United States remains a vital 
            partner in the search for peace and will continue to consult 
            closely with President Clinton and Secretary Albright in the 
            period ahead.
