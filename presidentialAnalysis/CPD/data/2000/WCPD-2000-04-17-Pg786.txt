Statement on the Announcement of a Summit Meeting Between South Korea 
and North Korea

April 10, 2000

    I welcome the announcement that the Republic of Korea and the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea will hold a historic first summit 
in June. Direct dialog between the two Koreas is something we have long 
advocated and is fundamental to solving the problems of the Korean 
Peninsula. This announcement is testimony to the wisdom and long-term 
vision of President Kim Dae-jung's engagement policy. I congratulate 
both leaders on their decision to meet.
