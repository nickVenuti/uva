Christmas Greeting to the Nation

December 24, 2000

    The President. On this holiest of holidays, Hillary and I would like 
to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas. Tonight we gather with family 
and friends to reflect on our good fortune, rejoice in the memories of 
the year past, and look forward with hope to the days ahead.
    And we give thanks to America's men and women in uniform, who are 
spending this holiday protecting freedom around the world.
    The First Lady. And we also remember those who are too often left 
behind, because Christmas isn't just about getting gifts; it's about the 
miracle of giving them. As we enjoy our last Christmas in the White 
House, the President, Chelsea, and I are profoundly grateful for the 
gift you've given our family, the privilege of serving your family these 
last 8 years.
    The President. So from our family to yours, Merry Christmas, Happy 
New Year, and God bless you all.
