Statement on Organ Donation Legislation

April 12, 2000

    I am pleased by Senator Frist and Senator Kennedy's announcement 
that they have reached a compromise on legislation that moves our Nation 
forward to promote greater equity and effectiveness in the allocation of 
our Nation's organ supply. This compromise takes a first step towards 
ensuring that those Americans most in need of receiving these life-
saving resources will be able to better access them. At the same time, 
we must redouble our efforts to encourage voluntary donation by all 
Americans.
