Statement on Senate Confirmation
of Norman Y. Mineta as Secretary
of Commerce

July 22, 2000

    I am grateful that the Senate has acted expeditiously to confirm 
Norman Y. Mineta as Secretary of Commerce, and am pleased that he was 
sworn in to office today.
    As a Member of Congress for 21 years, Mr. Mineta was a leader on 
trade, technology, and other issues critical to the emerging digital 
economy. He brings to his new post not only an indepth understanding of 
American business and the needs of our high-tech economy but also a deep 
concern for people--especially those not yet fully participating in this 
economy. He will play a crucial role in keeping our economic strategy on 
track, opening trade around the world, investing in our people, 
promoting high technology, and bridging the digital divide.
    Mr. Mineta also has been a passionate voice for opportunity and 
justice for all. Stirred by his experiences as a young boy during World 
War II, when he and his family were relocated to a Japanese-American 
internment camp, he has fought tirelessly to ensure that others are 
spared such injustice. I am proud to welcome him as the first Asian-
Pacific American ever to hold a post in the President's Cabinet and 
congratulate him on his confirmation.
