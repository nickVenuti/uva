Statement on Senate Action on Legislation To Provide Permanent Funding 
To Protect Critical Lands

July 14, 2000

    I am pleased that a bipartisan agreement was reached today in the 
Senate on legislation to provide permanent funding to protect critical 
lands across America. We have before us an historic opportunity to build 
a truly enduring conservation endowment. I commend Senator Bingaman and 
Senator Murkowski for their leadership in moving us closer to that goal. 
I am committed to working with Congress in the bipartisan spirit 
reflected in today's agreement so that future generations will have the 
resources to protect precious lands, from city parks to threatened 
farmland to our grandest natural treasures.
