Statement on the Death of Bob Squier

January 24, 2000

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened by the death of Bob Squier. Bob 
was a valued adviser, a good friend, and a fine man. His loyalty, 
talent, and, above all, his perseverance helped Vice President Gore and 
me craft a winning reelection campaign in 1996 when many had counted us 
out. I owe him much.
    Throughout the course of his career, Bob was a pioneer in the art of 
modern communications. With his documentary films, his pathbreaking 
political commentary, and his work for progressive candidates, Bob 
helped make policy and politics understandable and exciting for millions 
of Americans. Our thoughts and prayers tonight are with Prudy, his sons, 
and grandchildren.
