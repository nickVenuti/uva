Statement on Russian President Vladimir Putin's Decision To Pardon 
Edmond Pope

December 9, 2000

    I welcome President Putin's statement of his intent to pardon and 
release Edmond Pope. It will be a great relief to all Americans when Mr. 
Pope is finally freed and reunited with his family. We want to see him 
home and safe as soon as possible.
