Statement on the Death of Pierre Trudeau

September 28, 2000

    I was deeply saddened to learn today of the death of Pierre Trudeau. 
As Prime Minister for nearly a generation, Pierre Trudeau opened a 
dynamic new era in Canadian politics and helped establish Canada's 
unique imprint on the global stage. I know his passing will be felt by 
all Canadians. Hillary joins me in offering the condolences of the 
American people to his two sons and to the people of Canada.
