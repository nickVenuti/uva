Statement on the Death of Senator Paul Coverdell

July 18, 2000

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Senator 
Paul Coverdell.
    Paul Coverdell spent a lifetime serving the people of Georgia and 
our country. He was a tireless advocate who worked to ensure that 
children have access to quality education. And he was a leader in 
America's war against drugs. As Director of the Peace Corps, he proudly 
carried America's spirit of volunteerism around the world.
    I join all Americans in honoring Paul Coverdell for his years of 
service as a soldier, a public servant, and a statesman. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with his wife, Nancy, his family, and his many friends.
