Statement on Easing Sanctions Against North Korea

June 19, 2000

    Since last September, when I announced the measures being 
implemented today to ease sanctions against North Korea, North Korea has 
maintained its moratorium on missile tests. These measures are supported 
by our close allies in the region and are part of the process of close 
coordination between the United States, Japan, and South Korea 
recommended by former Secretary of Defense William Perry. We will 
continue to build on these efforts and on the recent North-South summit 
to achieve additional progress in addressing our common proliferation 
concerns.
