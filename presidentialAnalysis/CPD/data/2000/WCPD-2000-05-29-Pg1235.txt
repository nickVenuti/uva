National Monument Fire

May 26, 2000

    This administration is committed to ensuring that all those who have 
been affected by the fire that began at Bandelier National * Monument 
are fully compensated for their losses. At this time, we are working 
with the New Mexico delegation to craft legislation that would govern 
Federal compensation and make available the funds needed to pay for this 
legislation. We are committed to working with the Congress to ensure 
that this matter is addressed as promptly as possible.
