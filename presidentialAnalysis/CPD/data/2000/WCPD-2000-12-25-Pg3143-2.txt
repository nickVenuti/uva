Statement on the Death of John Lindsay 

December 20, 2000

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of John 
Lindsay. As a Member of Congress, and later as mayor, John Lindsay built 
a remarkable rapport with the people of New York City--people of every 
race, in every neighborhood, in every walk of life. In times of great 
change, John Lindsay was a progressive yet pragmatic force for the 
public interest. New Yorkers and all Americans will miss not only his 
confident style but his commitment to social progress for all.
