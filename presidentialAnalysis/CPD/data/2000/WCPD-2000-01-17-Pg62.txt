Statement on the Death of Tom Foerster

January 12, 2000

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Tom 
Foerster, who for 40 years served the people of Allegheny County with 
pride, distinction, and most of all, compassion. Tom's years in office, 
a record 28 of them as Allegheny County commissioner, should serve as an 
example to everyone of what a public servant ought to be.

    Throughout his long political career, Tom always put the needs of 
the people of Allegheny County first. I was particularly pleased that 
last year Tom decided to return to politics and was victorious in his 
race for a seat on the Allegheny County Council.

    Hillary and I extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Georgeann, 
and to his family.
