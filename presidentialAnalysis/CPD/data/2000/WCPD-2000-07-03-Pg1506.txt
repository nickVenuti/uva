Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process

June 26, 2000

    The Northern Ireland peace process has been given a tremendous boost 
forward by the announcement that Martti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa 
have inspected several IRA arms dumps and issued a positive report on 
their findings through the Independent International Commission on 
Decommissioning. The fact that the IRA has reestablished contact with 
the Commission is equally significant, representing a tangible step 
toward fulfillment of its undertaking to put arms beyond use in the 
context of full implementation of the Good Friday accord. I urge all 
paramilitary organizations and political parties to build on this 
progress. I believe all the people of Northern Ireland should take heart 
from these harbingers of lasting peace.

Crisis Group.
