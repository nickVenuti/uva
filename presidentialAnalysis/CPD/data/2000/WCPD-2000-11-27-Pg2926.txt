Statement on Signing the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000

November 22, 2000

    Today I am pleased to sign into law S. 2712, the ``Reports 
Consolidation Act of 2000.'' This Act, which passed with bipartisan 
support, provides permanent authority for Federal agencies to 
consolidate certain financial and performance reports into a single, 
comprehensive annual report.
    This Act builds on the success of a pilot program started in 1994 
and represents an important step in the maturity of financial management 
reporting by the Federal Government. An agency can now combine its 
audited financial statements, as required by the Chief Financial 
Officers Act, and its performance reports, required by the Government 
Performance and Results Act.
    These new consolidated reports will give the American people a more 
comprehensive and useful picture of the many important services we 
provide to the Nation.
                                            William J. Clinton
 The White House,
 November 22, 2000.

Note: At the time of publication, S. 2712, approved November 22, had not 
been received by the Office of the Federal Register in time for 
assignment of a public law number.
