Statement on Signing the Energy Act of 2000

November 9, 2000

    Today I am pleased to sign the ``Energy Act of 2000,'' which 
contains a number of measures to strengthen America's energy security 
that I have repeatedly urged Congress to act on this year. This 
legislation reauthorizes the operation of the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, a critical line of defense against the threat of energy 
shortages, and guarantees that a full range of tools will be available 
to secure America's energy supplies. In addition, this legislation 
establishes an appropriate trigger for the use of the 2 million barrel 
Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve that I directed my administration to 
establish earlier this year. This will help provide an insurance policy 
against supply shortages and price spikes in winters and assist 
consumers who rely on heating oil to heat their homes.

The act also makes changes in the Weatherization Assistance Program to 
reduce State costs and better serve low-income Americans.
