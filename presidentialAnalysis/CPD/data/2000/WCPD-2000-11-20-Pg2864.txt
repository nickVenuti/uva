Statement on the Death of Leah Rabin

November 12, 2000

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened this morning to learn of the 
death of Leah Rabin. We have lost a dear friend, and the Middle East has 
lost a friend of peace. But the work to which she and Yitzakh dedicated 
their lives must and will continue.
    Our prayers are with the Rabin family and with the people of Israel.
