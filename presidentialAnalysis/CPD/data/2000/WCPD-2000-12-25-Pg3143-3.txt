Statement on Action by India and Pakistan To Reduce Tensions in Kashmir

December 20, 2000

    I welcome today's announcements by both India and Pakistan aimed at 
reducing tensions in Kashmir. The decision by Prime Minister Vajpayee 
that India will continue the ceasefire it initiated last month in 
Kashmir is an important step forward. In the meetings we held earlier 
this year the Prime Minister told me of his determination to pursue a 
course of peace in Kashmir. I applaud today's announcement as a sign of 
his continuing commitment to that course. This initiative, along with 
Pakistan's announcement today that it will withdraw part of its forces 
deployed along the Line of Control and its earlier decision to exercise 
maximum restraint there, raises the hopes of the world community that 
peace is possible in Kashmir. To achieve that end, I continue to believe 
that all parties should reject violence and work for a peaceful 
resolution of the conflict through dialog.
