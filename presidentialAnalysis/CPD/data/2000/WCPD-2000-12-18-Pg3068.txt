Statement on the Signing of the Ethiopia-Eritrea Final Peace Agreement

December 12, 2000

    I congratulate the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea for the final 
peace agreement signed today in Algiers. My relief and happiness on this 
occasion mirrors the sadness I felt when I witnessed two allies and 
friends embroiled in a tragic conflict. I look forward to resuming our 
strong cooperation with Ethiopia and Eritrea across the spectrum of 
bilateral issues.
