Statement on the National Economy

October 6, 2000

    Today, thanks to our economic strategy and the hard work of the 
American people, we reached another dramatic milestone in our 
unprecedented economic expansion--the unemployment rate has fallen to 
3.9 percent, matching the lowest level in 30 years. Unemployment for 
African-Americans fell to the lowest level ever recorded, and for 
Hispanics it remains at historic lows. This is more good news for the 
American people and another reminder that those who advocate 
irresponsible tax plans that would jeopardize our fiscal progress are 
taking America down the wrong economic path.
