Statement on Signing an Executive Order Creating the Commission on 
Workers, Communities, and Economic Change in the New Economy

October 27, 2000

    Today I am pleased to sign an Executive order creating a Commission 
on Workers,

[[Page 2657]]

Communities, and Economic Change in the New Economy. I would like to 
thank Representative Ken Bentsen for his leadership in helping workers 
and communities adapt to the new economy and for working with my 
administration to form this Commission.
    International trade, technology, globalization, and the changing 
nature of work present extraordinary new opportunities for Americans but 
can also create real disruptions for American workers and communities. 
Vice President Gore and I have worked hard to empower workers and 
communities to take advantage of the many opportunities in this new 
economy, but there is still more we can do. This Commission will 
undertake a careful examination of the effectiveness of existing Federal 
programs to help workers and communities adjust to economic change and 
will identify the best practices of employers, communities, and public-
private partnerships that have responded successfully to economic 
dislocations. The Commission's report, due next year, will help 
communities, employers, and workers respond to and benefit from these 
changes in our economy.
