Statement on the Unemployment Rate

November 3, 2000

    Today we received more good economic news for the American people. 
Our Nation's unemployment rate has held steady at 3.9 percent--the 
lowest in more than 30 years, and half of what it was in 1992.
    The drop in Hispanic unemployment over the last 8 years has been 
just as spectacular. Hispanic unemployment is at an all-time low of 5 
percent, down from 11.8 percent in 1992. African-American unemployment 
remains at record lows. Wages and incomes for all Americans continue to 
rise across the board. More than 22 million new jobs have been created 
since Vice President Gore and I came to office.
    For nearly 8 years, Vice President Gore and I have worked to 
maintain a course of fiscal discipline that has helped lead to the 
longest economic expansion in American history and put America on course 
to pay down the debt by 2012. This commitment has had tangible results. 
More Americans are working hard, creating opportunity, and reaching 
their dreams than ever before. Let's stay on this course of fiscal 
discipline and ensure that our children and their children enjoy even 
greater economic prosperity.
