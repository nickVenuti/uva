Radio Remarks on the Social Security Internet Retirement Planner

April 7, 2000

    For more than 60 years now, Social Security has provided a measure 
of financial security for seniors after a lifetime of work. Beginning 
today, Americans of all ages can log on to the Internet and find out in 
seconds the amount of Social Security benefits they can expect in 
retirement. The new on-line retirement planner estimates future benefits 
based on past, present, and projected future income. Just log on to the 
Social Security web site at www.ssa.gov, and click on the new Social 
Security retirement planner. It's never too early to plan you financial 
future.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 3:10 p.m. 
in the Oval Office at the White House for later broadcast. These remarks 
were also made available on the White House Press Office Actuality Line.
