Statement on the Death of David Brower

 November 6, 2000

     I was saddened to learn today of the death of David Brower, one of 
the earliest and most ardent defenders of the extraordinary natural 
heritage that enriches and unites all Americans. Over more than half a 
century, from Cape Cod to the Grand Canyon to the Alaska wilderness, he 
fought passionately to preserve our Nation's greatest natural treasures. 
His fiery activism helped build and energize the modern environmental 
movement, rallying countless people to the defense of our precious 
planet. Like the towering redwoods of his native California, David 
Brower's conservation legacy will stand tall and proud for generations 
to come.
     Hillary and I extend our deepest condolences to his wife Anne, his 
family, and his many friends and supporters throughout the world.
