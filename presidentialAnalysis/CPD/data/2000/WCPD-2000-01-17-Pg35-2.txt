Statement on the Resignation of Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre

January 10, 2000

    Today Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre announced that he will 
step down from his position at the end of March. I want to express my 
deep gratitude to John for his outstanding service to America.
    Since becoming the Deputy Secretary in July 1997, John Hamre has 
been a respected, decisive, and forward-leaning leader. He directed 
implementation of the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review and the Defense 
Reform Initiative. He put in place a wide range of innovative defense 
management initiatives and worked tirelessly on reforms of defense 
contracting. His impact in these areas will be felt long after his 
departure.
    Dr. Hamre also was a pivotal adviser as we ensured that the 
readiness challenges of our Armed Services are addressed with necessary 
resources. He was a driving force behind the increase in the defense 
budget and the increased benefits for military personnel that I signed 
into law last year. He also led Department of Defense efforts to ensure 
that their critical computer systems were not affected by Y2K problems.
    Although I will miss his advice as Deputy Secretary, I am pleased 
that the Nation will continue to benefit from his vast knowledge and 
experience in defense policy. I wish John Hamre all the best as he moves 
on to become president and chief executive officer of the Center for 
Strategic and International 
Studies.
