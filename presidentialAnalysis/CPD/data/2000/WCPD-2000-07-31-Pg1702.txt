Radio Remarks on Restoration of the Wild Salmon of the Pacific Northwest

July 27, 2000

    Today my administration is proposing a comprehensive strategy to 
bring back the wild salmon of the Pacific Northwest. We'll pursue a 
practical course that will help both the economy and the environment. 
Congress must also do its part by fully funding my salmon restoration 
budget, and the people of the Pacific Northwest must be prepared to take 
the necessary steps. Only in partnership with State and tribal 
governments and other stakeholders can we restore the salmon without 
resorting to costlier measures. I welcome the recommendations of the 
region's Governors and look forward to working together to ensure our 
success.

 Note:  The President's remarks were recorded at 2:30 p.m. in the Oval 
Office at the White House for immediate broadcast. These remarks were 
also made available on the White House Press Office Actuality Line.
