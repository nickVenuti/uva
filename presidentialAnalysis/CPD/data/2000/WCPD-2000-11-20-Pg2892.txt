Statement on the Death of Hosea Williams

November 17, 2000

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of an 
American foot soldier for freedom and a driving force for the Voting 
Rights Act, Hosea Williams. From his bravery in the fields of battle in 
World War II to his leadership in the civil rights struggle at home, 
Hosea Williams was a profile in courage. One of the greatest honors of 
my Presidency was walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with him on 
the 35th anniversary of the Selma march earlier this year. Hosea 
Williams dedicated his entire life to making sure we never take a detour 
on the road to freedom. He helped us all cross the bridge to a better 
and more just world. With his memory as a guide, we'll keep marching on. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.
