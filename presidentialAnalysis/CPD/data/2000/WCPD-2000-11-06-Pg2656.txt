Statement on Signing Legislation To Provide a Plaque Commemorating 
Martin Luther King's ``I Have a Dream'' Speech

October 27, 2000

    I am proud to sign legislation today authorizing placement of a 
marker commemorating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic ``I Have a 
Dream'' speech at the Lincoln Memorial. Few leaders in American history 
have spoken with the eloquence, passion, and moral force that Dr. King 
did that day, uttering words that, a generation later, still echo in our 
hearts.
    His call to action captured the spirit of an America struggling to 
fulfill its promise of freedom, of a democracy yet to honor all of its 
citizens. Even today, his words still inspire millions of people around 
the world who believe in the extraordinary power of nonviolent change to 
bring about social justice.
    Let all who visit the Lincoln Memorial pause to reflect upon Dr. 
King's words and strive to make that dream real in their hearts and 
daily lives.
