Statement on Action in the Northern Ireland Peace Process

February 11, 2000

    The Good Friday accord, made possible by the courage of leaders from 
both of Northern Ireland's communities, responded to the people's 
overwhelming desire for peace. It has been sustained by those leaders 
making the tough decisions necessary to keep the process moving forward. 
I regret that the IRA did not give the de Chastelain Commission a more 
timely commitment on arms decommissioning to maintain the momentum 
toward full implementation of the accord--a commitment which reflects 
the wishes of the vast majority of people both in Ireland and in 
Northern Ireland.
    At the same time, we have seen real progress in the past few days. 
This progress is reflected in the most recent report from the de 
Chastelain Commission, which states that the commitment made by the 
IRA's representative ``holds out the real prospect of an agreement which 
would enable [the Commission] to fulfill the substance of its mandate.'' 
I urge all the parties to build on that progress, remain engaged, and 
carry through on their responsibilities to work together to achieve the 
full implementation of the Good Friday accord.
