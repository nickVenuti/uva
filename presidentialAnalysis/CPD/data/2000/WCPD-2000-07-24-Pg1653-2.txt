Memorandum on the 2000 Combined Federal Campaign
of the National Capital Area

July 14, 2000

Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: 2000 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area

    I am delighted that the Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater 
has agreed to serve as the Chair of the 2000 Combined Federal Campaign 
of the National Capital Area. I ask you to enthusiastically support the 
CFC by personally chairing the campaign in your agency and appointing a 
top official as your vice chair.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. Public servants not 
only contribute to the campaign but also assume leadership roles to 
ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help positively influence 
thousands of employees and will guarantee another successful campaign.
                                            William J. Clinton
