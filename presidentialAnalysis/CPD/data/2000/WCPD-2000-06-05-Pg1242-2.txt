Statement on the Meat and Poultry Inspection System

May 26, 2000

    When this administration came into office, meat and poultry were 
inspected by the same old method used for 90 years. In 1996, we began a 
comprehensive, science-based system that, for the first time, requires 
plants to reduce bacterial contamination in meat and poultry.
    This system has been a tremendous success. In just 2 years, the 
presence of dangerous salmonella on meat and poultry has been reduced by 
up to 50 percent, and illnesses caused by salmonella are also down.
    Unfortunately, a small minority of meat plants are acting against 
the best interests of the American people. They threaten to undermine an 
inspection system that is clearly effective in reducing food poisoning, 
jeopardizing the confidence that consumers have in the safety of the 
food they eat.
    The Justice Department has vigorously defended this vital program 
and will decide on an expedited basis what further legal action to take. 
I am also calling on the food industry to use its vast resources to help 
ensure that all meat processing plants maintain the strictest possible 
safety standards.
    This administration will continue to use every available tool to 
ensure that our food supply remains the safest in the world.
