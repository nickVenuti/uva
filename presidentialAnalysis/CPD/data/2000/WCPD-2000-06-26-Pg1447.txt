Statement on the Shootings of Government Meat Inspectors

June 22, 2000

    I was shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic shootings of three 
government inspectors, including two U.S. Department of Agriculture 
employees, in California. The Federal Government is working closely with 
local authorities on this matter. This grievous act was committed 
against dedicated individuals who were working to ensure the public's 
health and safety. I want to join all Americans in extending our 
thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families and coworkers.
