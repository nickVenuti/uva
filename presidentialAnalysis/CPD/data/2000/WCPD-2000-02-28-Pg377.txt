            to take demonstrable steps to implement the Joint 
            Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in 
            which the Government of North Korea has committed not to 
            test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy, 
            or use nuclear weapons, and not to possess nuclear 
            reprocessing or uranium enrichment facilities;

            Framework.
    Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 576(d) of the Act,

of the United States to furnish up to $15 million in funds made 
available under the heading ``Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism,

    You are hereby authorized and directed to report this certification 
and waiver to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the 
Federal Register.
