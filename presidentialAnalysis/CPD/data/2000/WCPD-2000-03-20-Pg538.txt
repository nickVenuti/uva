Notice--Continuation of Iran Emergency

March 13, 2000

    On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, 
including its support for international terrorism, efforts to undermine 
the Middle East peace process, and acquisition of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means to deliver them. On May 6, 1995, I issued 
Executive Order 12959 imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further 
respond to this threat, and on August 19, 1997, I issued Executive Order 
13059 consolidating and clarifying these previous orders. The last 
notice of continuation was published in the Federal Register on March 
12, 1999.
    Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue 
to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must 
continue in effect beyond March 15, 2000. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the 
emergency declared by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency 
separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 
12170, this renewal is distinct from the emergency renewal of November 
1999. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.
                                            William J. Clinton
The White House,
March 13, 2000.
