Statement on the Death of Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
of Japan

June 20, 2000

    I was saddened to learn of the death of former Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita and wish to extend my condolences to his wife, Naoko, his 
daughters, and the Japanese people. Mr. Takeshita was a strong supporter 
of close U.S.-Japan relations and a good friend of the United States.
