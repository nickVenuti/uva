Statement on the Supreme Court Decision To Uphold  Miranda  v.  Arizona 

June 26, 2000

    In 1966 the Supreme Court decided in Miranda  v.  Arizona  that law 
enforcement officials must give certain warnings, including a suspect's 
right to remain silent and to have counsel, before criminal suspects are 
questioned in custody. I am very pleased that today the Supreme Court by 
a large majority, has affirmed that ruling and upheld the important 
constitutional rights protected by Miranda. As Chief Justice Rehnquist's 
opinion notes, the warnings have become part of our national culture; 
they have worked for law enforcement by providing clear standards for 
our officers; and they have worked to protect the rights of our 
citizens. I am pleased that today's opinion so resoundingly reinforces 
the important place of the Miranda warnings in our Nation's criminal 
justice system.
