October 26, 2000

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Construction Appropriations Act, 2001, on current U.S. policy and 
strategy for counterdrug assistance to Colombia and neighboring 
countries. The enclosed

report sets forth the rationale for expanded support to Colombia and 
neighboring countries and highlights the comprehensive initiatives now 
underway in the Andean region in support of the National Drug Control 
Strategy.
    Colombia's success in combating the threat of drugs is profoundly in 
the interest of the United States. A peaceful, democratic, and 
economically prosperous Colombia will result in a significant reduction 
of the supply of illicit drugs and help promote democracy and stability 
throughout the hemisphere. I am proud of the bipartisan effort that has 
made our Colombian initiative possible.
     Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Letters were sent to Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations; Ted Stevens, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Appropriations; Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman, House Committee on 
International Relations; and C.W. Bill Young, chairman, House Committee 
on Appropriations. An original was not available for verification of the
