Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Iran

November 9, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)

    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the Iran emergency declared by Executive 
Order 12170 on November 14, 1979, is to continue in effect beyond 
November 14, 2000, to the Federal Register for publication.
    Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and 
the process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran 
is still underway, the national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, 
and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, 
must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2000. Therefore, I have 
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with 
respect to Iran for 1 year.
     Sincerely,
                                            William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
