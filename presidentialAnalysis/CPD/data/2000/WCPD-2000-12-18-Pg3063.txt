Statement on the Termination of Irish Deportation Proceedings

December 11, 2000

    I strongly support the Attorney General's decision, at the request 
of the Secretary of State, to take action to terminate deportation 
proceedings against six individuals and to refrain from initiating 
proceedings against three others. All nine individuals had served 
sentences in the United Kingdom for activity connected with the IRA but 
are physically present in the United States. While in no way approving 
or condoning their past criminal acts, I believe that removing the 
threat of deportation for these individuals will contribute to the peace 
process in Northern Ireland. The Attorney General's decision is 
consistent with steps taken by the British Government under the Good 
Friday accord to release prisoners in Northern Ireland and reintegrate 
them into normal society as part of a process of reconciliation. Her 
decision will also reinforce efforts by the Governments and the parties 
in Northern Ireland to implement in full all aspects of the Good Friday 
accord.
