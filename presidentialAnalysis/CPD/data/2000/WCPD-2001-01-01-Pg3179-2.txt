Christmas Greeting to the Nation

December 24, 2000

    The President. Hillary and I want to wish all of you a very Merry 
Christmas. Tonight we gather with family and friends to reflect on our 
good fortune, rejoice in memories of the last year, and look forward 
with hope to the year ahead.

    The First Lady. So from our family to yours, Merry Christmas, Happy 
New Year, and God bless you all.

 Note:  The greeting was videotaped at approximately 4 p.m. in the Map 
Room on December 19 for later broadcast, and the transcript was made 
available by the Office of the Press Secretary on December 22 but was 
embargoed for release until 12:01 a.m., December 24. These remarks were 
also made available on the White House Press Office Actuality Line.
