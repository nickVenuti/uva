    The President. Hi, Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International].
    Q. Do you have the votes?
    The President. We don't know yet.
    Q. How are the votes going?
    The President. We don't know yet. That's why we're here today. We're 
working it.
    Q. You don't know?
    The President. If we can get the right bill before them, we have the 
votes. I don't know if we've got the votes to get the right bill before 
them, you know, to get through all the thicket of rulemaking. But we're 
working it.
