Statement on Federal Action on Potential Electricity Shortages in 
California

August 3, 2000

    Today I am directing all Federal agencies to take steps to reduce 
consumption of electricity in California to the maximum extent possible. 
As one of the largest power consumers in California, it is critical that 
the Federal Government take every possible step to reduce non-essential 
power consumption at Federal facilities in the State.
    During power shortage emergencies, it also is important that we 
increase our generation of power in the West, much of which is supplied 
to California customers. Therefore, I also am directing that Federal 
agencies that generate power, and the Federal Power Marketing 
Administrations, take all possible steps to maximize the amount of 
electricity that can be delivered to California.
    These short-term measures will assist California utilities and 
consumers in meeting electricity needs during this critical period.
