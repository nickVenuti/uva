Statement on the Crash of Singapore Airlines Flight SQ-006 in Taiwan

November 1, 2000

    I want to express my deepest condolences to the families who lost 
loved ones in the crash of Singapore Airlines Flight SQ-006 in Taiwan 
yesterday. It is too early to know the cause of the accident, but the 
United States is helping Taiwan authorities find the answers. A team 
from the National Transportation Safety Board is on its way to Taiwan 
now to assist with the investigation. We are also doing all we can to 
assist the victims and their families, both through the American 
Institute in Taiwan and the American Red Cross in Los Angeles.
