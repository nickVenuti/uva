Statement on Protection of Forest Roadless Areas

May 9, 2000

    The plan proposed today by Secretary Glickman to prohibit road 
building in roadless areas of our national forests is an important step 
toward my goal of lasting protection for these priceless lands. These 
pristine areas are some of the last wild places in America, and I am 
firmly committed to preserving them for future generations. I commend 
the Forest Service for its extraordinary effort in developing this 
proposal and providing the American people with every opportunity to 
help shape it. I encourage members of the public and all those with a 
stake in the future of our national forests to carefully review this 
proposal and make their voices heard as the Forest Service continues to 
develop and refine this historic initiative.
