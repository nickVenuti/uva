Statement on Senate Action on a National Blood Alcohol Content Standard 
To Combat Drunk Driving

June 15, 2000

    Today the Senate took an important step forward to keep drunk 
drivers off our Nation's streets. I congratulate the Senate for 
including a lifesaving measure championed by Senators Lautenberg and 
Shelby to set a national standard for impaired driving at .08 blood 
alcohol content (BAC) in the Transportation appropriations bill that 
passed today. This reasonable standard will save hundreds of lives and 
prevent countless injuries each year--and it should be put in place 
across the country without further delay. I strongly urge the Congress 
to pass a final Transportation spending bill that includes this 
important initiative. Working together, we can help put the brakes on 
drunk drivers and make our streets safer for Americans across the 
Nation.
