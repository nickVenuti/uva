August 2, 2000

    I commend the citizens of Colorado who took an important step today 
toward reducing gun violence by submitting nearly twice the number of 
signatures needed to place an

initiative on the State ballot to close the gun show loophole. Colorado 
voters can now do what Congress has failed to do: close a deadly 
loophole that allows criminals, juveniles, and other restricted persons 
to buy guns at gun shows with no questions asked.
    With our Nation losing 10 children to gunfire every day, Congress 
should heed the voices of millions of Americans concerned about gun 
violence--not those of the gun lobby--and follow the lead of States like 
Colorado. While Colorado's progress is encouraging, we should not have 
to rely on a patchwork of State laws when it comes to protecting our 
children's safety. Only Congress can pass legislation that protects 
children all across America. National legislation to close the gun show 
loophole and keep guns out of the wrong hands should be passed without 
further delay.
