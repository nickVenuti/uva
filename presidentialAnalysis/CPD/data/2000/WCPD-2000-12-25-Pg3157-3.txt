Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa, 2000

December 22, 2000

    One of the best ways we can shape the future is to preserve what we 
value of our past. The celebration of Kwanzaa is a wonderful example of

communities to our success as a nation in the years to come.
    African Americans have a proud history and a rich heritage. During 
this holiday season, as Americans of many different back-grounds 
remember and rejoice in their cultural and religious traditions, let us 
all give thanks for the diversity that is among America's greatest 
strengths, and let us unite around the shared dreams and values that 
bind us together as one nation.
    Hillary joins me in sending best wishes to all for a memorable 
Kwanzaa and for peace and happiness in the years to come.
                                            William J. Clinton
