Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Statement on the Death of Donna Summer May 17, 2012 Michelle and I were saddened to hear about the passing of Donna Summer. A five-time Grammy Award winner, Donna truly was the Queen of Disco. Her voice was unforgettable, and the music industry has lost a legend far too soon. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Donna's family and her dedicated fans. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Summer, Donna. Names: Obama, Michelle; Summer, Donna.
