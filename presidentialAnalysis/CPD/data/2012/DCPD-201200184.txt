Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Statement on Representative Gary L. Ackerman's Decision Not To Seek Reelection March 16, 2012 For over 30 years, Gary Ackerman has represented the people of Queens and Long Island, first as a New York State senator and then as a Member of Congress. Gary's bipartisan efforts helped our Nation confront significant challenges at home and abroad. He was a leader in the fight to pass Wall Street reform and helped strengthen the bonds between the United States and our allies, particularly Israel. Always a champion of his fellow New Yorkers, Gary was also successful in enacting a bill to create the "Heroes" postage stamp, which benefited the families of rescue workers killed or permanently disabled while responding to the 9/11 attacks. Gary's unique enthusiasm will be greatly missed in the halls of Congress, but I am confident he will continue to serve the people of New York for years to come. Michelle and I wish him and his family well in the future. Categories: Statements by the President : Ackerman, Rep. Gary L, decision not to seek reelection. Names: Ackerman, Gary L.; Obama, Michelle.
