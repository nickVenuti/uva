Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Statement on the Observance of Easter April 6, 2012 This Sunday, Michelle and I will join Christians across the country and around the world to celebrate Easter and give thanks for the all-important gift of grace. Easter is a time to reflect on both Christ's suffering and ultimate triumph, as the anguish of the cross continues to give way to the victory of resurrection. So to all those celebrating with us, we extend our warmest Easter greetings and best wishes in the days ahead. Categories: Statements by the President : Easter. Names: Obama, Michelle.
