Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Remarks During a Tour of the Industrial Assessment Center at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida February 23, 2012 This is for background because you guys just came in. What this facility does is teach these outstanding young engineers how to do energy assessments for manufacturersâ€”industrial buildings across the board. And so far they have, how many, 200 assessments, saving these companies up to 25 percent in their energy usage. And that's going to end up saving them millions of dollars. So it's a great example of how people are being trained, right now, to make our businesses more energy efficient all across the country. All right.
