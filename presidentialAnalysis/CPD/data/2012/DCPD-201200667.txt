Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Statement on the Death of Neil A. Armstrong August 25, 2012 Michelle and I were deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Neil Armstrong.  Neil was among the greatest of American heroesâ€”not just of his time, but of all time. When he and his fellow crew members lifted off aboard Apollo 11 in 1969, they carried with them the aspirations of an entire nation. They set out to show the world that the American spirit can see beyond what seems unimaginable, that with enough drive and ingenuity, anything is possible. And when Neil stepped foot on the surface of the Moon for the first time, he delivered a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.  Today, Neil's spirit of discovery lives on in all the men and women who have devoted their lives to exploring the unknown, including those who are ensuring that we reach higher and go further in space. That legacy will endure, sparked by a man who taught us the enormous power of "one small step." Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Armstrong, Neil A. Names: Aldrin, Edwin E.
