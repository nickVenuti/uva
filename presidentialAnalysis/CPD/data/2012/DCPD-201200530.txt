Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Statement on the Death of Andy S. Griffith July 3, 2012 Michelle and I were saddened to hear about the passing of Andy Griffith this morning. A performer of extraordinary talent, Andy was beloved by generations of fans and revered by entertainers who followed in his footsteps. He brought us characters from Sheriff Andy Taylor to Ben Matlock and, in the process, warmed the hearts of Americans everywhere. Our thoughts and prayers are with Andy's family.
