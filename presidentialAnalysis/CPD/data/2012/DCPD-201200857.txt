Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Remarks to an Overflow Crowd at a Campaign Rally in Springfield, Ohio November 2, 2012 Hello, Wildcats! How's everybody doing today? You doing good? Well, listen, I'm not going to give a long speech here. I just wanted to come by and say it's great to see all of you. And as I'm looking around, there are a lot of you who are too young to vote, but you're not too young to make sure your parents vote. You're not too young to tell your uncles and aunties and grandpas and grandmas to vote, because this is a big election. And if we win Ohio, we're going to win this election. So I just want to say thank you to all of you. And I'm going to come shake some hands, all right. It's great to see you guys. Thank you. NOTE: The President spoke at 1:11 p.m. at Springfield High School. Audio was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
