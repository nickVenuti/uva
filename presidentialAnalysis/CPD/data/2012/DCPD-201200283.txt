Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Statement on the Death of Richard W. Clark April 18, 2012 Michelle and I are saddened to hear about the passing of Dick Clark. With "American Bandstand," he introduced decades' worth of viewers to the music of our times. He reshaped the television landscape forever as a creative and innovative producer. And of course, for 40 years, we welcomed him into our homes to ring in the new year. But more important than his groundbreaking achievements was the way he made us feel: as young and vibrant and optimistic as he was. As we say a final so long to Dick Clark, America's oldest teenager, our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends, which number far more than he knew.
