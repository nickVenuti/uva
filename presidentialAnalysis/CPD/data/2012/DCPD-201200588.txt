Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Statement on the Death of Sally K. Ride July 23, 2012 Michelle and I were deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Sally Ride. As the first American woman to travel into space, Sally was a national hero and a powerful role model. She inspired generations of young girls to reach for the stars and later fought tirelessly to help them get there by advocating for a greater focus on science and math in our schools. Sally's life showed us that there are no limits to what we can achieve, and I have no doubt that her legacy will endure for years to come. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Sally's family and friends. Categories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Ride, Sally K. Names: Obama, Michelle; Ride, Sally K.
