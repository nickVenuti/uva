Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day April 19, 2012 On this Holocaust Remembrance Day, I join people of all faiths across the United States, in Israel, and around the world in paying tribute to all who suffered in the Shoah, a horrific crime without parallel in human history. We honor the memory of 6 million innocent men, women, and children who were sent to their deaths simply because of their Jewish faith. We stand in awe of those who fought back, in the ghettos and in the camps, against overwhelming odds. And in the year of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Raoul Wallenberg, we are humbled by the rescuers who refused to be bystanders to evil. On this day and all days, we must do more than remember. We must resolve that "never again" is more than an empty slogan. As individuals, we must guard against indifference in our hearts and recognize ourselves in our fellow human beings. As societies, we must stand against ignorance and anti-Semitism, including those who try to deny the Holocaust. As nations, we must do everything we can to prevent and end atrocities in our time. This is the work I will advance when I join survivors and their families at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on Monday. This must be the work of us all as nations and peoples who cherish the dignity of every human being. Categories: Statements by the President : Holocaust Remembrance Day.
