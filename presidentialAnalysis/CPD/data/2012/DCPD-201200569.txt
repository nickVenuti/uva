Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Statement on Extending Health Insurance Coverage to Federal Firefighters July 17. 2012 Starting today, the brave men and women of our Nation's Federal firefighting forces, as well as their families, will have access to the health coverage they deserve. Their heroism in battling the deadly fires that have impacted States across the country this summer inspires us all. Each day, these Americans put themselves in grave danger to save the lives of people they never met, which is why I directed my administration to ensure that our Nation's firefighters can count on the care and protection they need.
