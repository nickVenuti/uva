Administration of Barack Obama, 2012 Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation To Aid Veterans Seeking Employment July 12, 2012 No veteran who fought for our Nation overseas should have to fight for a job when they return home. That's why I'm pleased that Democrats and Republicans in Congress have come together to pass legislation that will make it easier for veterans to put their skills to work. This legislation complements the new partnership launched by my administration that will make it easier for manufacturing companies to hire thousands of returning servicemembers who have the skills our country needs. And it builds on several steps my administration has taken to help veterans find a job. Already we have created new tax credits for businesses that hire veterans. The Joining Forces initiative, begun by the First Lady and Dr. Biden, has helped 90,000 veterans and military spouses find jobs. And we have developed online tools to help connect veterans to employers. We've made progress, but we have much more to do. Congress needs to pass legislation creating a Veterans Job Corps so we can put our returning heroes back to work as cops and firefighters and on projects that protect and preserve our public lands and resources. And we must all continue our efforts to ensure that these talented men and women who would be an asset to any company have every opportunity to succeed after they serve our Nation.
